<h2 id="recent-happenings-snazz">Recent Happenings üìÖ (Snazz)</h2>
<p>Patch 2.0.1 has been released with a ton of new content. The new Corrupted Galleon‚Äôs Graveyard dungeon was added to the Forgery üê∏, allowing for a higher mythic chance by completing all eight dungeons. In addition, the Underworld Crypt dungeon bossfight got some love with a new revamp of Charon. Finally, the Breaking Point Quest was added for the Canyon Colossus. You can read the full changelog here: https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/2-0-1-full-changelog.304461/</p>
<p>The next major update was announced to be the addition of the Province of Fruma. Though the new region will be an endgame area, the dev team promised to include content for all levels as well as an increased level cap. You can read the original post here: </p>
<p>https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/work-on-fruma-is-ongoing.305082/</p>
<p>Since Christmas is just around the corner, we have temporarily added the 25/7 CHRISTMAS voice channel with a bot that plays Christmas music for 25 (?) hours a day.</p>
<p>Our resident Llamas Ugastag and Biblonko as well as BlueTheSniper have been cooking up plenty of events. Congrats to those who won the Wynncraft trivia event: Callum, GebutterteWurst, Snazz, xKaerynn, Aemor, RotemRotem, EchoLuu, and CensingMarker51. We also had hide and seek in Troms and Lusuco. The llamas used zones on the map which would close over time to keep things moving. Congrats to ScientificSnake, GebutterteWurst, Asoart, Snazz, Assassin420, and 4NZ1K for winning! Blue has also hosted a variety of events including Mineplex Minigames and other minigames. Thank you everyone else for participating!</p>
<p>In addition we have the upcoming CHRIMUH SKIN COMPETITION! Dress up in your most festive outfit to win rewards! Find out more in the events channel on Discord.</p>
<p>We also recently held a giveaway thanks to Calluum, Aemor, and T1Hunna for generously providing the prizes. Congrats to <code>Mavely, robopig3000, _EliteNightmare, withstands, add1kted, 1Fps, xKaerynn, Skoneez, and NothingButBread_</code> for winning!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Adonis, we have a couple more events to cover. For ESI‚Äôs Trick or Treat event, there were tasks to complete to earn points for prizes. Among the winners, in ANO we had Snazz üôÄ. I only did 1 task and somehow won the biggest multiplier. Also, the TNA Speedrun Challenge is ending soon. Be sure to submit your runs for LE rewards! If you aren‚Äôt already in the Adonis Discord, the link is in the #guild-info channel.</p>
<p>Our annual Secret Santa is currently underway! Everyone participating will give the requested present to Calluum, who will then distribute to the person who requested it. Merry Christmas to everyone in it.</p>
<p>Finally, congrats to everyone who got promoted! We have a lot so here is everyone:</p>

<h2 id="events-a-deeper-dive-on-their-impacts-bee">Events: A Deeper Dive on Their Impacts üåé (Bee)</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, I know it‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve heard from me in this form, but hi! I‚Äôm not dead! You may also notice that this Titan Times is looking a bit different to some of the more previous publications I‚Äôve worked on. We‚Äôre trying something new by showcasing more writers (one perspective gets pretty boring after a while if you ask me)! Hopefully all of you can get just as excited about the changes as I am. But enough digressing!</p>
<p>Being both a war and community guild, events are an important part of how we can tend to our community side. There are many types of events to be experienced in your time in ANO; that got me thinking: how do different types of events impact our players? Are they happy with the frequency and type of events we‚Äôre hosting? What about official serverwide events such as the 2nd Annual Festival of the Bonfire not too long ago? </p>
<p>While our warring members are of course an important aspect of the guild, I wanted to see how well we were taking care of our community players (and of course not forgetting the players who engage with both)! To figure this out, I went ahead and interviewed a handful of members of all ranks to gain a wider perspective on how the members of ANO feel about our events!</p>
<p>While some direct quotes from their answers might be added for notable responses, I‚Äôll be generous and summarize the conglomerate of responses I received (also a huge shoutout to those of you who were willing to answer all my questions with thoughtful, in-depth responses. It helps to make my writing more interesting and, in this case, will hopefully give our events team helpful feedback)! So without further ado, let‚Äôs get into it.</p>
<h4 id="have-you-attended-in-game-events-created-by-the-wynn-content-team-andor-participated-in-other-guild-hosted-events-either-in-game-or-otherwise-if-so-which"><strong>Have you attended in-game events created by the Wynn content team and/or participated in other guild-hosted events either in game or otherwise?

    margin-block-start: 1em;
    margin-block-end: 1em;
    margin-inline-start: 40px;
    margin-inline-end: 40px;">
Of course this had to be my first question to help establish a common ground. Everyone I spoke with had played in the Festival of the Bonfire back in September, but other common responses were the trivia events hosted by the Llamas and events hosted over in our community alliance, Adonis. 
</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sidetracking for a moment here, for those of you who might be new here or just missed this somehow, we‚Äôre part of a community alliance that hosts events with AVO and ESI every so often. If that seems like something you might be interested in, make sure you use the invite link in #guild-info for the discord!</p>

This was nearly unanimous in answer, which didn‚Äôt surprise me at all (I definitely play more during the Festival events). Our guild members love the opportunity to obtain exclusive cosmetics and event items!

The Festival of the Bonfire from this past year seemed to be ANO‚Äôs favorite thus far, even amongst those who had played during other festivals. The minigame in this event was a crowd favorite.

Personally, I wish the Wynn content team leaned harder into the lore they‚Äôve created. They leave a lot of loose threads in their lore, and they frequently have 1 quest involving a certain world built aspect just to have it never come up again (looking at you Eltom). I digress; other members seem pretty evenly split. Some people feel similar to me and think complete worldbuilding is very important to them, where others don‚Äôt care much about the lore at all. Lamadile had a great take, saying ‚Äú[... I] still enjoy [the game] very much so I'd say not very important, although definitely worth experiencing [...].‚Äù

There were some good responses here. While Twelven and others really like these types of events as they are, Lamadile was thinking more events similar to the Wynnter Fair with unique areas and minigames, and Seaskipper had the thought of using minigames as a way to obtain higher tier festival crates rather than having the daily + weekly quests be the only way to obtain them besides actually purchasing them off the store (which for the record, I think could be a FANTASTIC idea because it gives people more incentive to interact with more of the event features).

The biggest roadblock for people joining in on guild organized events was time. Because of a lot of time zone differences, many of the people I spoke with felt frustrated that they weren‚Äôt able to attend more of these events because they‚Äôre frequently unable to attend. Lack of attendance wasn‚Äôt for lack of wanting to! But players didn‚Äôt want to drastically change their IRL plans in order to attend an event at odd hours for them. Many said they would join if they were available because they wanted to improve their sense of community.

Almost all my respondents rated the amount of enjoyment improval at a 5 or higher, with the exception of Micah, who did still mention these types of events improved his enjoyment of the game, just not as highly as other players. I think Asoart said it best: ‚ÄúI love the [guild-hosted] in-game events [...] it makes it easier for the people to join and makes the guild more active overall.‚Äù

This question made me realize just how many new players we‚Äôve welcomed into our community in the last year! While the likelihood of ANO Wynnterfest taking place this year is still uncertain (Ice is usually the organizer and host for this event, but he is on long-term hiatus for now), I still wanted to feel out players‚Äô thoughts for an event of this magnitude and see if there were any suggestions that could be implemented for future years (or any other event on a large scale)! Most of my respondents have never attended ANO Wynnterfest, but Cyntie‚Äôs suggestion really stood out to me: I think events could be two times a day [...] there is such a big difference in time zones from western countries and eastern countries, most people from a certain time zone aren‚Äôt able to make it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt expect this to be such a polarizing question, seeing as these types of events have been hosted with a bit higher frequency in the last several months. Some players mentioned these types of events being their favorite and want to see more of these. Other players like these events least, noting the turnout was lower compared to when they‚Äôd attended other events hosted in Wynncraft. Personally, I have yet to attend an event like this, but I hope to join at some point in the future!

Two main standouts here: Wynncraft Trivia and Mineplex Minigames (or Hypixel, both were mentioned by multiple people)! Our guild members like easy to understand and want the most people to be able to join and have fun. And really, why hold events if the rules are difficult to understand and people don‚Äôt want to join? I think our events team has been great about keeping things simple in the time I‚Äôve been in ANO, which makes our time spent together that much more enjoyable!

<p>Here‚Äôs a handful of responses:</p>
<p>‚ÄúI appreciate our cabinets on making wynncraft community more fun and giving people something to enjoy beside the casual wynncraft gameplay‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI love the fact that the guild hosts events, I plan on participating in many events in the future!‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI'm looking forward to any and all christmas related events, hoping there will be a secret santa too.‚Äù (wish granted hehe)</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes events‚Äù</p>
<p>Certainly lots to think about when it comes to how, why, and what types of events we host! This one was for you, events team, so hopefully you‚Äôll take something away from all of this, and hope the rest of you enjoyed reading about some of our thoughts about the events we host. If you have any suggestions about future events, feel free to talk with anyone who has the Titans Spirit role, or consider applying to the cabinet yourself if you‚Äôd like to take a more active role in planning and hosting events for your fellow guild members to enjoy. Thanks for taking the time to read my (and everyone else‚Äôs) writings, and I hope to see you all at future events!</p>
<h2 id="festival-of-the-blizzard-geb">Festival of the Blizzard ‚ùÑÔ∏è (Geb)</h2>
<p>Just like last year around Christmas time, Salted has blessed us with another Wynncraft Event! This time around it‚Äôs the Festival of the Blizzard, a winter/Christmas-themed event that brings with it the usual redesign of Detlas, fun minigames, free crates as well as an NPC fetch quest.</p>
<h4 id="a-quick-guide-to-collecting-npcs"><strong>A quick guide to collecting NPCs üïµÔ∏è</strong></h4>
<p>Similarly to last year, you get to invite all kinds of NPCs from around the map about the Christmas festivities in Detlas! The more you collect, the more of them will be in Detlas to give you gifts by the time Christmas rolls around. To start the quest, simply talk to The Traveler below the big Christmas tree in Detlas; he will tell you who you should look for! Then you go out and travel the world in search of new NPCs to add to your collection! </p>
<p>Most of the NPCs available will most likely be the same as last year, so veterans will have an easier time completing The Traveler‚Äôs tasks. But don‚Äôt fret just because you weren‚Äôt here for the event last year, I'm sure some kind soul will create a list with all the NPCs and where to find them on the forums, just like they have for every previous event.</p>
<p>Once the NPCs you talked to have arrived in Detlas, you get to chit-chat with them there to learn about what they‚Äôve been up to recently. Besides learning some interesting lore, some of the NPCs will also hand out gifts if you know which dialogue options to choose. So don‚Äôt hesitate too long or you might miss out on some fancy gifts and collectibles.</p>

<h4 id="minigames-in-north-lusuco"><strong> Minigames in North Lusuco üõ∑ </strong></h4>
<p>As this event is centred around Christmas, the Minigame Hub for this event is located in North Lusuco! You can get there either with the event airship from Detlas or by taking the usual route through the tunnel in Lusuco. Awaiting you there is a multitude of minigame:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Santa Says:</strong> You and up to 2 other players get to complete fast-paced tasks for Santa. There is a huge variety of tasks ranging from baking cakes to rescuing reindeer </li>
<li><strong>Dodge Em</strong>: In this game, one of your turns into the hunter that has to activate icicles to try and push down all other players as they frantically dodge your attacks before the time limit runs out </li>
<li><strong>Thin Ice</strong>: Up to 8 players get to compete in a TNT-Run style game to see who survives the longest. Anyone that fell down early gets to watch from a spectator area above the arena</li>
<li><strong>Pig Puck</strong>: While this game is available all year round, now is the best time to grab your friends, form two teams and go head to head in this ice hockey inspired game</li>
<li><strong>Parkour</strong>: The parkour invites all players that dare to attempt it to a challenging set of parkour gauntlets, but most players just cheese the whole thing with movement spells anyway</li>
</ul>
<p>Spread around North Lusuco are a bunch of cool NPCs selling Christmas-themed armour, accessories and collectibles, but most of them are in no way worth the hefty price tag they come attached to (although I heard the Yahya Tree is pretty nifty).</p>
<h4 id="christmas-themed-detlas-and-blizzard-crates"><strong>Christmas-themed Detlas and Blizzard crates üéÅ</strong></h4>
<p>I hope you like the new Detlas, it‚Äôs here to stay all the way up to New Year‚Äôs Day, which is when the Festival of the Blizzard will end. This will give you plenty of time to admire the reworked Detlas, granted you‚Äôre not out looking for NPCs or playing minigames. Out of all the reworked versions of Detlas, the Christmas-themed one probably has the most for you to find and interact with. Like the Yeti next to the big Christmas tree in the centre. Or all the souvenir merchants, references to past events, and the NPCs from around the provinces you invited. With all of that going on, I would not be surprised if there was a secret or two, or even three for you to uncover in this event‚Äôs version of Detlas.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/703019773965107250/1053491393563205642/Jz0WMwyKWrGmaWZPH4BXoFjC97015uQOs3D7kCR6w4jcHhdUhywKfnHaY3BiSLD5eOvXG0aDRLHrcOfPpmYy8T9UhnWCDeryC3-YXEBZb1iVE-SSfNgpv0N9lJMfefbHkUyLLacw3LCf6V8QRT4g0Wud9DQj4cIIZLMTsR4j731XTiZhiuRAtgA.png
" width=60%><br /> <caption> </caption></center></p>
<p>While you‚Äôre busy with all the Christmas shenanigans, don‚Äôt forget to do your daily and weekly objectives to get the special Blizzard Crates. You can get a T1 chest every day and a T2 chest once a week, meaning you can get up to 30 free crates if you also get the 3 from the shop! Free crates are nice and all, but don‚Äôt let that stop you from gambling away all your money by buying more crates from the Wynncraft Store to get those sweet cosmetics. </p>
<h4 id="comments-from-the-community"><strong>Comments from the community</strong></h4>
<p>As per usual I asked some members of the community to share their thoughts on the event. These are some of the answers I received:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe worst thing about the new Detlas is that there isn‚Äôt more of it‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy does playing Santa Says feel like doing tasks in Among Us?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy are you asking me I only logged on to do my daily objective‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBetter than the Bonfire event‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMinigames were actually pretty fun ngl‚Äù</p>
