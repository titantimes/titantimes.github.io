I know it has been quite some time since we\u2019ve had one of these, but I am glad to finally have my own edition of the Times to share with all of you! It has been a long time (and a lot of procrastination on many fronts) in the making, so if you\u2019re seeing this, it means I finally rubbed some brain cells together. Recent Happenings As I\u2019m sure most of you are aware at this point, the new hierarchy was rolled out a few weeks ago! It\u2019s simpler and easier to follow than the one prior, so hopefully no one is too confused anymore. In case you didn\u2019t know, it works like this: In-Game Rank Rank Recruit Magi Recruiter Sorcerer Captain/Strategist* Artificer Strategist/Chiefs* Titan Chief Sage Council Callum + GNC Archmage *= some strats and chiefs are Titan rank Basically, the cabinets aren\u2019t woven into the hierarchy anymore, so ranking up is based more on activity! You can still join any of the 3 cabinets separately too. Also, the cosmetic roles still exist separately from all other roles, which are based only on the length of time you\u2019ve been a part of the guild. If you have more questions about the new system, ask any member of Council! Additionally, there have been some notable promotions since the new hierarchy was put into effect. Be sure to give some congratulations to these members! GebutterteWurst : promoted to Titan 4NZ1K, Ugastag, Biblonko : promoted to Artificer, and even more recently passed the strati test! ThrowMusket, dmorgia, DarkDot, DDuk_Eip, _EliteNightmare, Za_Lemon, Yathin_, Habidudi, Penstick, _brown_bear_, Teraphims, StellarWombat, LeftToGame , Asoart , and Senshiz : all promoted to Sorcerer Good job everyone, and to the rest of you, maybe your name could be up here soon enough! We also just had another Gartic Phone event, which was a huge success. I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing more of these in the future, so keep an eye out on the events channel if you want to join in the future! Gif saved by Snazz. Real footage of intense Gartic match. Military Updates With the end of Season 5 upon us, I thought I\u2019d give a recap of how ANO made out. Our military team was able to successfully defend our ocean claim for the season, and we had a good amount of relative peace. ANO made it into the top 10 for the Season Rankings, ranking 6th overall. Congrats to everyone that helped out this season, and let\u2019s hope for another success next season! This was also our first season being a part of the new Cucumber Company war alliance! While there were a few adjustments to member guilds partway through, overall we worked together to hold our claims. If you\u2019re interested in helping out with the war effort or participating in FFA during offseason, consider asking a Council member for military roles to get started and always feel free to ask questions! Main Stage The thing I wanted to talk about most this edition, the recent formation of our new community alliance with ESI, Adonis! With the decline of our other community alliance, Hestia, the leaders of ESI and ANO decided we needed a space for those of us who are still active to hang together. Hestia is still around, but our events team will be planning alliance events for Adonis only from now on. We do have a Discord server if you haven\u2019t already joined! Ask a council member for an invite if you\u2019d like to check it out (this is not mandatory however, but we do get up to some shenanigans in #counting ). We recently had our inaugural event, a Trivia night! This one was hosted by the ESI events team, and I was actually able to attend (unlike most events we host cause they\u2019re at bat shit wild times for us EST people). I very much enjoyed our first event and I hope to see all of you at the next one! Since the ESI team hosted the first event, that means it\u2019s on us to plan and host the next one for Adonis, so if you have any interest in that, consider applying for Spirit if you have some ideas! Member Shout of the Publication Aiza , for being a Cool Dude\u2122 Trivia Fact : Did you know that when Mars rover Curiosity sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to itself on its first anniversary of being on the planet? This technically makes Curiosity\u2019s solo birthday wishes the first song to be played on another planet. A Quick Word From the Author If you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you! I was really unsure about taking over the Times on my own, and spent a lot of days putting it off because I didn\u2019t want to fall short of anyone\u2019s expectations I hope this was an enjoyable read for you all, and if you liked it, then keep your eyes peeled for the next edition in the future. Also if there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to see as part of the next publication, feel free to toss your suggestions to me or any other Brilliance member. Or, if you think you\u2019d like to be a part of the production of our newspaper, apply for Brilliance! Once again, thank you for reading this one and I hope you\u2019ll look forward to many more to come! bitesizedbee4 <3","title":"Volume 1"},{"location":"vol1/#volume-1","text":"","title":"Volume 1"},{"location":"vol1/#8-may-2022","text":"","title":"8 May 2022"},{"location":"vol1/#titan-times-a-new-edition","text":"Hello everyone!
