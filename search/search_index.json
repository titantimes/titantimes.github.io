I know it has been quite some time since we\u2019ve had one of these, but I am glad to finally have my own edition of the Times to share with all of you! It has been a long time (and a lot of procrastination on many fronts) in the making, so if you\u2019re seeing this, it means I finally rubbed some brain cells together. Recent Happenings As I\u2019m sure most of you are aware at this point, the new hierarchy was rolled out a few weeks ago! It\u2019s simpler and easier to follow than the one prior, so hopefully no one is too confused anymore. In case you didn\u2019t know, it works like this: In-Game Rank Rank Recruit Magi Recruiter Sorcerer Captain/Strategist* Artificer Strategist/Chiefs* Titan Chief Sage Council Callum + GNC Archmage *= some strats and chiefs are Titan rank Basically, the cabinets aren\u2019t woven into the hierarchy anymore, so ranking up is based more on activity! You can still join any of the 3 cabinets separately too. Also, the cosmetic roles still exist separately from all other roles, which are based only on the length of time you\u2019ve been a part of the guild. If you have more questions about the new system, ask any member of Council! Additionally, there have been some notable promotions since the new hierarchy was put into effect. Be sure to give some congratulations to these members! GebutterteWurst : promoted to Titan 4NZ1K, Ugastag, Biblonko : promoted to Artificer, and even more recently passed the strati test! ThrowMusket, dmorgia, DarkDot, DDuk_Eip, _EliteNightmare, Za_Lemon, Yathin_, Habidudi, Penstick, _brown_bear_, Teraphims, StellarWombat, LeftToGame , Asoart , and Senshiz : all promoted to Sorcerer Good job everyone, and to the rest of you, maybe your name could be up here soon enough! We also just had another Gartic Phone event, which was a huge success. I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing more of these in the future, so keep an eye out on the events channel if you want to join in the future! Gif saved by Snazz. Real footage of intense Gartic match. Military Updates With the end of Season 5 upon us, I thought I\u2019d give a recap of how ANO made out. Our military team was able to successfully defend our ocean claim for the season, and we had a good amount of relative peace. ANO made it into the top 10 for the Season Rankings, ranking 6th overall. Congrats to everyone that helped out this season, and let\u2019s hope for another success next season! This was also our first season being a part of the new Cucumber Company war alliance! While there were a few adjustments to member guilds partway through, overall we worked together to hold our claims. If you\u2019re interested in helping out with the war effort or participating in FFA during offseason, consider asking a Council member for military roles to get started and always feel free to ask questions! Main Stage The thing I wanted to talk about most this edition, the recent formation of our new community alliance with ESI, Adonis! With the decline of our other community alliance, Hestia, the leaders of ESI and ANO decided we needed a space for those of us who are still active to hang together. Hestia is still around, but our events team will be planning alliance events for Adonis only from now on. We do have a Discord server if you haven\u2019t already joined! Ask a council member for an invite if you\u2019d like to check it out (this is not mandatory however, but we do get up to some shenanigans in #counting ). We recently had our inaugural event, a Trivia night! This one was hosted by the ESI events team, and I was actually able to attend (unlike most events we host cause they\u2019re at bat shit wild times for us EST people). I very much enjoyed our first event and I hope to see all of you at the next one! Since the ESI team hosted the first event, that means it\u2019s on us to plan and host the next one for Adonis, so if you have any interest in that, consider applying for Spirit if you have some ideas!

Welcome back to another release of the Times (this level of consistency in the future? Don\u2019t count on it), the best way to get a quick digest of our recent activities and thoughtful insights on all things Wynn! This one was a lot of fun to put together, so hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy it! Recent Happenings Geb hosted a scavenger hunt over in Adonis, in which participants had to search for designated areas around Gavel based on nondescript images. Some of these were really tough (I definitely wasn\u2019t attempting to find each spot even though I couldn\u2019t attend the live event)! Luckily, our own Biblonko, fatfatsheep87, StellarWombat, TheZeldaBoi, Cal, AssassinThugs, and JoeDeez were able to win some prizes, along with some of our ESI friends. Good job to our excellent scavengers! Additionally, Miles hosted a Wynn trivia event in game. Each correct question was worth some LE, so I\u2019m sure it was rather heated! Good work to Snazzy, Geb, Cal, Ugastag, Biblonko, fatfatsheep87, and Aiza who all displayed their knowledge in the game and earned themselves the opportunity to buy themselves something nice. Basically, the cabinets aren\u2019t woven into the hierarchy anymore, so ranking up is based more on activity! You can still join any of the 3 cabinets separately too. Also, the cosmetic roles still exist separately from all other roles, which are based only on the length of time you\u2019ve been a part of the guild. If you have more questions about the new system, ask any member of Council! Now, my favorite part to write: promotions! Not nearly so many as our last recap, but I did have some catching up to do. I\u2019m happy to let you all know (or remind you for those of you who frequent our announcements) that JoeDeez , LoseStreak , and Slime1480 have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Many congratulations to them, and I hope to see their names, and others, in this spot soon. Military Updates Our beginning-of-season reclaim of our ocean territories went very smoothly. ANOcean lives to see another season! Since then, our FFAers have been busy with frequent struggles against our allies over in DUDE, AVO, TAq, and SDU (others slip in too, but are hardly worth the mention). FOOL has really been making fools of themselves by attempting to attack our claim more than once in the span of a week, but of course failing miserably. An additional reminder that our GXP for LE event will be continuing through the end of this season. This applies to all guild members, not just those who are military-oriented. As of recently, however, the next season of Ocean Trials has begun! For anyone who might not know, Ocean Trials is an incentive to help with wars for LE based on your war count at the end of the season. If you\u2019d like more information, head over to #ocean-trials-info, or ask a Council member for military roles for access to military channels. GXP gain in the last 2 weeks Miles' event. Screenshot by Aiza Main Stage As most of you likely already know, the Wynncraft dev team recently released the trailer for the upcoming 2.0 update (link here if you\u2019ve somehow missed it)! There are many exciting things to note in this trailer, including the overhaul of the combat system, a new raid, new quests, and the most talked-about surprise, subclasses and an ability tree! Personally, I can\u2019t wait to see what the new release brings and am very much looking forward to playing around with the changes, but I wanted to see what you thought. I interviewed a good handful of active players to get their thoughts on the trailer, and summarized the most popular thoughts here: ANO members were unanimous in saying they were looking forward to the 2.0 release. Some were even surprised at how much content was going to be updated. People were far and away most excited to hear about a skill tree and new class archetypes People thought that the new update would go in a different direction (Dern when amirite) but aren\u2019t upset about the new changes being implemented Some minor things people hope are addressed in the update include the dialogue system and archer\u2019s escape spell, but it is unclear if these changes will be included in the new update The biggest concern for current players was the surge of new and returning players, more guild activity, and possibly more frequent attacks on defender guilds. Additional comments in the words of RawGamingYT: \u201c(nessak sauna sauna sauna sauna sauna sauna)\u201d I of course was unable to talk to every single guild member, but if you have a specific point you want to talk about, feel free to throw it in general, or DM it to me!

Nah, I\u2019m not organized enough to stick to a schedule for this) digest of guild activity and thoughtful insights into all things Wynn! Lots has happened since my last release, so let\u2019s jump right into it! Recent Happenings First up on the docket, promotions! Aemor , Miles , CMYBilly , and RSpieter99 have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Additionally, ChristmasBear has been promoted to Artificer! Congrats to the 5 of you for your promotions, and I hope to see some new names up here soon. Next up, we had an insane build battle with our ESI friends over in Adonis. Players were split into teams of 3 and given a phrase with which to theme their builds on. Each team had the same amount of time to create their masterpieces. Judges awarded points based on the quality of the build, how well it matched the theme, and creativity of how the theme was executed. Here are some of the winning builds, along with a few other honorable mentions! We do events in Adonis on a somewhat regular basis, so if you\u2019re not in the discord and want in on the fun, be sure to head over to #guild-info and join the server! Morphion. Builders: Cal, Snazz, and Trig Photo taken by Petrae Avicia [AVO] has joined the Adonis alliance to host events and help reduce the load on [ESI] and [ANO]. Another exciting thing in the wider world of Wynn was the release of the full changelog for the Wynncraft 2.0: Spellbound Update! (this is pretty much hot off the presses as I\u2019m writing this but I\u2019m confident most of you have seen this anyway). Personally, I have mixed feelings about what\u2019s been announced, but hey I might just go mess around in the beta once it\u2019s released and see what it\u2019s all about. The \u201cupdated\u201d spells are what I feel most concerned about, but with so much of the ability tree unknown, it could be much better than expected. We\u2019ll all just have to wait and see, but 2.0 is coming soon and I\u2019ll certainly be jumping in to experience it! Is anyone else planning on starting a new class for the update? If you haven't read the full changelog yet, you can do so here . And last but definitely not least, ANO reached level 91! We always love to see the continued growth of this wonderful community. Keep working hard! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pc: Cal Military Updates Only a few short updates to keep this section brief. Gang of Fools [FOOL] has joined Cucumber Company, our military alliance. Their map claim is the old claim of IceBlue Team [IBT], who have left the alliance and gone mostly inactive. Sad to see them go, but [FOOL] is so far proving a worthy replacement. Some of our more active military participants have been hitting the FFAs hard these last few weeks, and putting us in 4th position (at time of writing) in the season ratings! Will we make it to the top 3? Not likely! Will we try anyway? Almost certainly! Also a reminder that our military document has had a bit of a facelift to reflect the current guild community conditions and our alliance change this season. If you haven\u2019t looked it over in a while, now is a good chance to do so! Or if you\u2019re not yet part of our military and would like to be, ask a council member for access to our military channels to get started. Main Stage: Awards Ceremony After nearly a year of trying to get our shit together and make this happen, it finally did: The ANO Awards Ceremony! Awards are given to distinguish players for a variety of reasons in both military and community sectors. I was unfortunately unable to attend this event myself (it was an odd hour for us EST peeps), so I\u2019ll just be giving a summary here. As it has been a while since the last awards ceremony, some of our medal recipients are no longer in the guild, but should still be noted for their efforts during their time in ANO. First up, the Service Medal, which is awarded to members who are active in our community and contribute some amount of XP to the guild. Recipients are as follows: RawGamingYT, BROthePRO, Ugastag, Biblonko, LizardGaming13, fatfatsheep87, Miles, ender_non, _Eth3real, LapisPig965, LaMDaKiS, Toasty, Hallomifrendo, GebutterteWurst, KingNoahWilliam, Trigonometri, Aiza, Ohza, and UrBroJosh ! Next up, the Conquest Medal, awarded to players who are active in our military and have participated in a number of successful guild wars. Recipients are as follows: Snazz, Toasty, Hallomifrendo, xXMemeLord69420, Ugastag, Biblonko, 4Nz1K, TheZeldaBoi, BROthePRO, iThought, and Aemor ! Next up we have the Guidance Medal, awarded to members who are seen helping others on a regular basis, and are just overall helpful players. Recipients are as follows: 4Nz1K, Slime1480, NotableOsprey92, and DDuk_Eip ! Following that, there\u2019s the Recruiter Award, granted to members who refer players to ANO that later end up becoming active members in our community. Recipients are as follows: Nimbuh, Aiza, Aezuh, and Habidudi ! Then we have the Invictus Cross, which is awarded to members who have contributed significantly to our military, and often take leadership roles during such. Recipients are LaMDaKiS, GebutterteWurst, and imperathor02 ! Next up is the Imperial Service Medal, which is awarded to leaders of foreign guilds for consistent acts of service to our guild. This time around, the award was granted to MysticStrider ! Following that is the Veteran Medal, granted to distinguished former members of ANO, who during their time with us were able to achieve a variety of accomplishments. Recipients are as follows: imperathor02, PaladinSorcerer, CoderNotGamer, and Leonhart_Arkada ! Finally, we have our newest award, the Valorian Star. This is not given frequently, and only awarded to members who have gone above and beyond in showing their dedication to the guild. I am happy to announce that Aiza is the recipient of this award! Many congratulations to all of our award recipients! I love seeing so many players being recognized for their efforts, and hopefully the next awards ceremony won\u2019t be over a year away so I can see more names hit this list in the future! There were actual seats to sit on. Just something to note, you can view your medals at any time by using -profile in #bots! editor's note: Raw is still working on the command lol. There will be an announcement once it is ready. Member Shout of the Publication _Yathin , for his loyalty and activity Trivia Fact : Baby turtles have a small egg tooth that aids in their hatching, but this tooth is lost shortly after they emerge. Closing Remarks Thank you all again for reading! I hope these releases are up to the standards of the people, but I will continue dropping reminders that if you ever have any ideas for things you want to see included in the Times, feel free to DM me! Or if you\u2019re interested in being a part of the Times, submit an application to Titan\u2019s Brilliance! Doing these on my own can sometimes take longer than I\u2019d like, but I always have fun with it.

Here are some of the winning builds, along with a few other honorable mentions! We do events in Adonis on a somewhat regular basis, so if you\u2019re not in the discord and want in on the fun, be sure to head over to #guild-info and join the server! Morphion. Builders: Cal, Snazz, and Trig Photo taken by Petrae Avicia [AVO] has joined the Adonis alliance to host events and help reduce the load on [ESI] and [ANO]. Another exciting thing in the wider world of Wynn was the release of the full changelog for the Wynncraft 2.0: Spellbound Update! (this is pretty much hot off the presses as I\u2019m writing this but I\u2019m confident most of you have seen this anyway). Personally, I have mixed feelings about what\u2019s been announced, but hey I might just go mess around in the beta once it\u2019s released and see what it\u2019s all about. The \u201cupdated\u201d spells are what I feel most concerned about, but with so much of the ability tree unknown, it could be much better than expected. We\u2019ll all just have to wait and see, but 2.0 is coming soon and I\u2019ll certainly be jumping in to experience it! Is anyone else planning on starting a new class for the update? If you haven't read the full changelog yet, you can do so here . And last but definitely not least, ANO reached level 91! We always love to see the continued growth of this wonderful community. Keep working hard! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pc: Cal","title":"Recent Happenings"},{"location":"vol3/#military-updates","text":"Only a few short updates to keep this section brief. Gang of Fools [FOOL] has joined Cucumber Company, our military alliance. Their map claim is the old claim of IceBlue Team [IBT], who have left the alliance and gone mostly inactive. Sad to see them go, but [FOOL] is so far proving a worthy replacement. Some of our more active military participants have been hitting the FFAs hard these last few weeks, and putting us in 4th position (at time of writing) in the season ratings! Will we make it to the top 3? Not likely! Will we try anyway? Almost certainly! Also a reminder that our military document has had a bit of a facelift to reflect the current guild community conditions and our alliance change this season. If you haven\u2019t looked it over in a while, now is a good chance to do so! Or if you\u2019re not yet part of our military and would like to be, ask a council member for access to our military channels to get started.","title":"Military Updates"},{"location":"vol3/#main-stage-awards-ceremony","text":"After nearly a year of trying to get our shit together and make this happen, it finally did: The ANO Awards Ceremony! Awards are given to distinguish players for a variety of reasons in both military and community sectors. I was unfortunately unable to attend this event myself (it was an odd hour for us EST peeps), so I\u2019ll just be giving a summary here. As it has been a while since the last awards ceremony, some of our medal recipients are no longer in the guild, but should still be noted for their efforts during their time in ANO. First up, the Service Medal, which is awarded to members who are active in our community and contribute some amount of XP to the guild. Recipients are as follows: RawGamingYT, BROthePRO, Ugastag, Biblonko, LizardGaming13, fatfatsheep87, Miles, ender_non, _Eth3real, LapisPig965, LaMDaKiS, Toasty, Hallomifrendo, GebutterteWurst, KingNoahWilliam, Trigonometri, Aiza, Ohza, and UrBroJosh !

Recipients are as follows: 4Nz1K, Slime1480, NotableOsprey92, and DDuk_Eip ! Following that, there\u2019s the Recruiter Award, granted to members who refer players to ANO that later end up becoming active members in our community. Recipients are as follows: Nimbuh, Aiza, Aezuh, and Habidudi ! Then we have the Invictus Cross, which is awarded to members who have contributed significantly to our military, and often take leadership roles during such. Recipients are LaMDaKiS, GebutterteWurst, and imperathor02 ! Next up is the Imperial Service Medal, which is awarded to leaders of foreign guilds for consistent acts of service to our guild. This time around, the award was granted to MysticStrider ! Following that is the Veteran Medal, granted to distinguished former members of ANO, who during their time with us were able to achieve a variety of accomplishments. Recipients are as follows: imperathor02, PaladinSorcerer, CoderNotGamer, and Leonhart_Arkada ! Finally, we have our newest award, the Valorian Star. This is not given frequently, and only awarded to members who have gone above and beyond in showing their dedication to the guild. I am happy to announce that Aiza is the recipient of this award! Many congratulations to all of our award recipients! I love seeing so many players being recognized for their efforts, and hopefully the next awards ceremony won\u2019t be over a year away so I can see more names hit this list in the future! There were actual seats to sit on. Just something to note, you can view your medals at any time by using -profile in #bots! editor's note: Raw is still working on the command lol. There will be an announcement once it is ready.","title":"Main Stage: Awards Ceremony"},{"location":"vol3/#member-shout-of-the-publication","text":"_Yathin , for his loyalty and activity Trivia Fact : Baby turtles have a small egg tooth that aids in their hatching, but this tooth is lost shortly after they emerge. Closing Remarks Thank you all again for reading! I hope these releases are up to the standards of the people, but I will continue dropping reminders that if you ever have any ideas for things you want to see included in the Times, feel free to DM me! Or if you\u2019re interested in being a part of the Times, submit an application to Titan\u2019s Brilliance! Doing these on my own can sometimes take longer than I\u2019d like, but I always have fun with it.
