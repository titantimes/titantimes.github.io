I know it has been quite some time since we\u2019ve had one of these, but I am glad to finally have my own edition of the Times to share with all of you! It has been a long time (and a lot of procrastination on many fronts) in the making, so if you\u2019re seeing this, it means I finally rubbed some brain cells together. Recent Happenings As I\u2019m sure most of you are aware at this point, the new hierarchy was rolled out a few weeks ago! It\u2019s simpler and easier to follow than the one prior, so hopefully no one is too confused anymore. In case you didn\u2019t know, it works like this: In-Game Rank Rank Recruit Magi Recruiter Sorcerer Captain/Strategist* Artificer Strategist/Chiefs* Titan Chief Sage Council Callum + GNC Archmage *= some strats and chiefs are Titan rank Basically, the cabinets aren\u2019t woven into the hierarchy anymore, so ranking up is based more on activity! You can still join any of the 3 cabinets separately too. Also, the cosmetic roles still exist separately from all other roles, which are based only on the length of time you\u2019ve been a part of the guild. If you have more questions about the new system, ask any member of Council! Additionally, there have been some notable promotions since the new hierarchy was put into effect. Be sure to give some congratulations to these members! GebutterteWurst : promoted to Titan 4NZ1K, Ugastag, Biblonko : promoted to Artificer, and even more recently passed the strati test! ThrowMusket, dmorgia, DarkDot, DDuk_Eip, _EliteNightmare, Za_Lemon, Yathin_, Habidudi, Penstick, _brown_bear_, Teraphims, StellarWombat, LeftToGame , Asoart , and Senshiz : all promoted to Sorcerer Good job everyone, and to the rest of you, maybe your name could be up here soon enough! We also just had another Gartic Phone event, which was a huge success. I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing more of these in the future, so keep an eye out on the events channel if you want to join in the future! Gif saved by Snazz. Real footage of intense Gartic match. Military Updates With the end of Season 5 upon us, I thought I\u2019d give a recap of how ANO made out. Our military team was able to successfully defend our ocean claim for the season, and we had a good amount of relative peace. ANO made it into the top 10 for the Season Rankings, ranking 6th overall. Congrats to everyone that helped out this season, and let\u2019s hope for another success next season! This was also our first season being a part of the new Cucumber Company war alliance! While there were a few adjustments to member guilds partway through, overall we worked together to hold our claims. If you\u2019re interested in helping out with the war effort or participating in FFA during offseason, consider asking a Council member for military roles to get started and always feel free to ask questions! Main Stage The thing I wanted to talk about most this edition, the recent formation of our new community alliance with ESI, Adonis! With the decline of our other community alliance, Hestia, the leaders of ESI and ANO decided we needed a space for those of us who are still active to hang together. Hestia is still around, but our events team will be planning alliance events for Adonis only from now on. We do have a Discord server if you haven\u2019t already joined! Ask a council member for an invite if you\u2019d like to check it out (this is not mandatory however, but we do get up to some shenanigans in #counting ). We recently had our inaugural event, a Trivia night! This one was hosted by the ESI events team, and I was actually able to attend (unlike most events we host cause they\u2019re at bat shit wild times for us EST people). I very much enjoyed our first event and I hope to see all of you at the next one! Since the ESI team hosted the first event, that means it\u2019s on us to plan and host the next one for Adonis, so if you have any interest in that, consider applying for Spirit if you have some ideas! Member Shout of the Publication Aiza , for being a Cool Dude\u2122 Trivia Fact : Did you know that when Mars rover Curiosity sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to itself on its first anniversary of being on the planet? This technically makes Curiosity\u2019s solo birthday wishes the first song to be played on another planet. A Quick Word From the Author If you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you! I was really unsure about taking over the Times on my own, and spent a lot of days putting it off because I didn\u2019t want to fall short of anyone\u2019s expectations I hope this was an enjoyable read for you all, and if you liked it, then keep your eyes peeled for the next edition in the future. Also if there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to see as part of the next publication, feel free to toss your suggestions to me or any other Brilliance member. Or, if you think you\u2019d like to be a part of the production of our newspaper, apply for Brilliance! Once again, thank you for reading this one and I hope you\u2019ll look forward to many more to come! bitesizedbee4 <3","title":"Volume 1"},{"location":"vol1/#volume-1","text":"","title":"Volume 1"},{"location":"vol1/#8-may-2022","text":"","title":"8 May 2022"},{"location":"vol1/#titan-times-a-new-edition","text":"Hello everyone!

Welcome back to another release of the Times (this level of consistency in the future? Don\u2019t count on it), the best way to get a quick digest of our recent activities and thoughtful insights on all things Wynn! This one was a lot of fun to put together, so hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy it! Recent Happenings Geb hosted a scavenger hunt over in Adonis, in which participants had to search for designated areas around Gavel based on nondescript images. Some of these were really tough (I definitely wasn\u2019t attempting to find each spot even though I couldn\u2019t attend the live event)! Luckily, our own Biblonko, fatfatsheep87, StellarWombat, TheZeldaBoi, Cal, AssassinThugs, and JoeDeez were able to win some prizes, along with some of our ESI friends. Good job to our excellent scavengers! Additionally, Miles hosted a Wynn trivia event in game. Each correct question was worth some LE, so I\u2019m sure it was rather heated! Good work to Snazzy, Geb, Cal, Ugastag, Biblonko, fatfatsheep87, and Aiza who all displayed their knowledge in the game and earned themselves the opportunity to buy themselves something nice. Basically, the cabinets aren\u2019t woven into the hierarchy anymore, so ranking up is based more on activity! You can still join any of the 3 cabinets separately too. Also, the cosmetic roles still exist separately from all other roles, which are based only on the length of time you\u2019ve been a part of the guild. If you have more questions about the new system, ask any member of Council! Now, my favorite part to write: promotions! Not nearly so many as our last recap, but I did have some catching up to do. I\u2019m happy to let you all know (or remind you for those of you who frequent our announcements) that JoeDeez , LoseStreak , and Slime1480 have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Many congratulations to them, and I hope to see their names, and others, in this spot soon. Military Updates Our beginning-of-season reclaim of our ocean territories went very smoothly. ANOcean lives to see another season! Since then, our FFAers have been busy with frequent struggles against our allies over in DUDE, AVO, TAq, and SDU (others slip in too, but are hardly worth the mention). FOOL has really been making fools of themselves by attempting to attack our claim more than once in the span of a week, but of course failing miserably. An additional reminder that our GXP for LE event will be continuing through the end of this season. This applies to all guild members, not just those who are military-oriented. As of recently, however, the next season of Ocean Trials has begun! For anyone who might not know, Ocean Trials is an incentive to help with wars for LE based on your war count at the end of the season. If you\u2019d like more information, head over to #ocean-trials-info, or ask a Council member for military roles for access to military channels. GXP gain in the last 2 weeks Main Stage As most of you likely already know, the Wynncraft dev team recently released the trailer for the upcoming 2.0 update (link here if you\u2019ve somehow missed it)! There are many exciting things to note in this trailer, including the overhaul of the combat system, a new raid, new quests, and the most talked-about surprise, subclasses and an ability tree! Personally, I can\u2019t wait to see what the new release brings and am very much looking forward to playing around with the changes, but I wanted to see what you thought. I interviewed a good handful of active players to get their thoughts on the trailer, and summarized the most popular thoughts here: ANO members were unanimous in saying they were looking forward to the 2.0 release. Some were even surprised at how much content was going to be updated. People were far and away most excited to hear about a skill tree and new class archetypes People thought that the new update would go in a different direction (Dern when amirite) but aren\u2019t upset about the new changes being implemented Some minor things people hope are addressed in the update include the dialogue system and archer\u2019s escape spell, but it is unclear if these changes will be included in the new update The biggest concern for current players was the surge of new and returning players, more guild activity, and possibly more frequent attacks on defender guilds. Additional comments in the words of RawGamingYT: \u201c(nessak sauna sauna sauna sauna sauna sauna)\u201d I of course was unable to talk to every single guild member, but if you have a specific point you want to talk about, feel free to throw it in general, or DM it to me!

Closing Remarks If you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you! I am starting to have a lot of fun putting these together, so I hope you all are enjoying reading as much as I am writing. As always, if there\u2019s something you want featured in the next edition, or you think you might want to help out in the future, send over an application to Titan\u2019s Brilliance (imagine being in Brilliance because you know how to code, couldn\u2019t be me and I\u2019m definitely not the only one who\u2019s here for creative endeavors).
