I know it has been quite some time since we\u2019ve had one of these, but I am glad to finally have my own edition of the Times to share with all of you! It has been a long time (and a lot of procrastination on many fronts) in the making, so if you\u2019re seeing this, it means I finally rubbed some brain cells together. Recent Happenings As I\u2019m sure most of you are aware at this point, the new hierarchy was rolled out a few weeks ago! It\u2019s simpler and easier to follow than the one prior, so hopefully no one is too confused anymore. In case you didn\u2019t know, it works like this: In-Game Rank Rank Recruit Magi Recruiter Sorcerer Captain/Strategist* Artificer Strategist/Chiefs* Titan Chief Sage Council Callum + GNC Archmage *= some strats and chiefs are Titan rank Basically, the cabinets aren\u2019t woven into the hierarchy anymore, so ranking up is based more on activity! You can still join any of the 3 cabinets separately too. Also, the cosmetic roles still exist separately from all other roles, which are based only on the length of time you\u2019ve been a part of the guild. If you have more questions about the new system, ask any member of Council! Additionally, there have been some notable promotions since the new hierarchy was put into effect.

Welcome back to another edition of the Titan Times: the best place to get your fill on guild activity and insights on all things Wynn! I\u2019m excited to present a special 10th volume for you all with some special guest writers (who you\u2019ll hopefully be seeing more of in the future if all goes well). With some Ocean Trials news, an intriguing critique, and some fun promotions, let\u2019s not delay any further. Grab your favorite snack and we\u2019ll tell all! Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5 In between the release of our last volume and this one, the 2nd annual Festival of the Heroes event brought additional flair to the usual gameplay for a few weeks. While I\u2019m sure you all had a chance to check out Festival Detlas, it\u2019s still worth the recap! Photos courtesy of KidOfCubes Special festival crates were available for a limited time, providing players with a wide range of unique cosmetics. Crates could be obtained for free by completing daily and weekly objectives. There were also the darts and color wheel activities, as well as the Call to Heroism minigame! Players were able to earn festival tokens to obtain unique trinkets and fun items. And let\u2019s not forget the scavenger hunt! Each day of the festival, a new box was hidden somewhere around the map for players to find after being provided a hint to the location (or just looking up the coordinates on the wiki if you\u2019re me). Each box found provided players with reward vouchers containing a variety of items. By reaching certain milestones of boxes found, players were able to obtain mildly useful items. Festivals like this come around every couple of months, so keep your eyes out in the future for the next one. Around the time this gets posted, it will be Wynncraft\u2019s 10th anniversary! Crazy to think this game has been around a whole decade now. It\u2019s changed a lot since those early days (RIP my pre 1.14 Fierte that went into the void). As of right now, it\u2019s unclear whether or not there will be any in-game celebration for this, but for now you can check out Salted\u2019s post on the Forums for some fun BTS pictures over the years. Check it out Here ! Let\u2019s round off this section with all of last month\u2019s promotions, shall we? Vampellao, Silent__Boss, _Ein_Wolf_, ___Apollo__, Long_tata, GamingProf, LordXaverius, Waiter1986, SaintEnder, IndomDoggo, MagischeTaube, ZoSo, Exhinder2295, Fire_209, and CrispperPlanet were all promoted to Sorcerer. Have fun climbing the rest of that ladder! iThought and OverFears were both promoted to Artificer for their efforts in warring and cabinet work respectively. Great work guys! Last, but certainly not least, a HUGE congrats to EchoLuu ! n her promotion to Titan. She has been dedicating so much effort into our warring scene and massively improving her skills as an economiser (all that on top of being an extremely cool guild member in general). I can\u2019t wait to see what else you\u2019ll do! Congrats to everyone who was recently promoted! I always look forward to seeing new names up here, but having a few big promotions really sweetens the deal. What\u2019s in the Cupboard?: ANO Cabinet Review Spirits Written by BeGruent Hey Titan\u2019s Valor, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite penguin, BeGruent. This time I will be the one that tells you what has been going on in Titan\u2019s Spirit since last edition. First of all, we had OverFears hosting his first event, Jackbox, which is a collection of games like Push the Button, Monster Seeking Monster, or Survive the Internet. Shortly after that he hosted two additional events, Risk and Minecraft Bingo. Risk is a strategy game where you have to attack your opponents and claim territories. Most of you should know Minecraft Bingo. For everyone that doesn\u2019t here\u2019s how it works: you get a 5x5 sheet and complete a row. The left image shows an example from the practicing round. But there wasn\u2019t only normal bingo, there was also Lockout and Manhunt. While Manhunt is normal bingo with the addition of one team having to kill all players before any other team wins, Lockout is different. Their whole bingo sheet needs to be completed, and as soon as a task is done it\u2019s locked for every team. The goal here is to get the most tasks done, as you see in the right image. Comparison between lockout and normal bingo Similar to Minecraft Bingo, I, BeGruent , made a sequel to my first ever event, Wynncraft Bingo. While last time I made it a Lockout, this time it was normal bingo. Additionally, instead of having 1 week to complete all tasks the participants only had 24 hours. Congratulations to the winners, which were Geb , who got the reward for the first row, linnyflower , who got the reward for being the first and only one to get every task done, and Crisperplanet , who got rewards for not only being the first one to complete 2 rows, but one for 3 and 4 row as well! Last but not least, our friends in [AVO] hosted an amazing Scavenger Hunt event over in Adonis, where you had to find a location using an image, similar to the Geoguesser event that Llamas hosted a while ago. Even though it was pretty difficult, [ANO] managed to secure 3 of 5 rewards. Geb once again took first place, BlueTheSniper got second, and Aemor secured 4th place. Huge congrats to all of you! That should wrap up the event section for this edition, have fun reading through the rest! If you ever feel the urge to make an event by yourself, don\u2019t hesitate to join the Spirit Cabinet! Applications can be created in #guild-info . Brilliance Brilliance projects take time, okay? This publication is probably the most routine thing that goes on in this cabinet (no shade to my fellow Brilliance members, I jest). The good news is that KidOfCubes is working on a systematic recreation of Wynncraft. If all goes well, it should be similar to Wynncraft but entirely open source. He\u2019ll be releasing a trailer for the project once it\u2019s completed, so look out for that in the (not so) near future. In worse news, anode, our war count mod, seems to be causing crash issues with Wynntils, so our Brilliance team is working to resolve that. There may be a new version of anode soon, so anyone participating in Ocean Trials will want to look out for that if a new version is needed. Still working on the fix :p. You can still use it but it will crash the chat tabs occasionally. (You can restart the chat tabs in Wynntils) Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f Season 11 ends, and season 12 begins! Congrats to all of our war participants last season, as we were able to sinch 3rd place in our season ratings! Congratulations to GebutterteWurst for having the most total wars this season and becoming Champion of the Ocean. If I had $1 for every SR point ANO has, I would have $6,042,104 That means that a new season of Ocean Trials has begun! For any new members who want to participate need to have anode installed in order to track your war count. Good luck this season everyone! As a side note, Ocean Trials rewards will be reverting back to the old system. This means that rewards are given out as a lump sum at the end of the season, instead of weekly like they were this past season. Main Stage: A Critique of Silent Expanse Quests \ud83d\ude2e Written by karapandza In this piece I will be explaining why I think the two quests that introduce the player to the Silent Expanse: A Journey Beyond & A Journey Further fail in many ways in introducing the player to this new region. When I think about what makes the Silent Expanse interesting, I immediately go to one thought. The mystery. And this is what both a Journey Beyond & a Journey Further can use best to their advantage. There is no area on Wynncraft that sheds any drop of semblance to the Silent Expanse. It is completely unique and mysterious. Before doing A Journey Beyond the player only gets a snippet or two of what is behind the gates of the mines. Without any outside knowledge the player does not know anything about what they are venturing into. But all of this mystery is completely lost by one thing. Aledar just simply already knows everything. This is my largest gripe with both quests. It makes them feel less like an adventure into an unknown land and more like a tour guide. The player does not experience the mysteries and wonders of this new land naturally, they are just told what certain things are and how they function. My next point of critique is the factor of importance. This is the first level 100 quest the player can do and throughout the quests one is told repeatedly that this mission is important, but I never got that feeling and I think this stems from one single thing. The people who are telling you this: Elphaba and Aledar. The player has interacted with Elphaba once before in the quest Reclaiming the House and in the case of Aledar the player has not seen him since the tutorial. These are great callbacks to the player's past experiences and encounters but in my eyes are not capable of presenting the importance of the mission. Since in my case I had completely forgotten who both are. But importance is also not present in a particular part of the quest: The player being chosen for the mission. At this point, the player is level 100, incredibly powerful and has been on a lot of adventures (if one decides to do a lot of the quests) yet for some reason you are never chosen to go on this mission. You randomly stumble into a room that plans this great adventure. This is a large missed opportunity to reward the player for reaching level 100 by specifically choosing them for their great feats and accomplishments. I still have one minor point I would like to add but that is not as large as the others. Simply the addition of a completely new element. In the first third of the quest after failing to defeat Black Geist the player goes to a Blacksmith for help. And he introduces a new Element. I do not have an issue with a new Element exclusive to the Silent Expanse, on the contrary, I think this would be an interesting idea but, in the quest, so little is done with it. After defeating the Black Geist, it is completely forgotten and not utilized again (the Wynncraft team may do more with this with the eventual release of Dern but in the current state of the game the Element of Darkness does not add anything). These two quests have the highest potential in the entire game and that is why it is so disappointing to me to see how they ended up. These would be some examples of my most simple suggestions that I believe would go a long way in improving the quests whilst fixing the issues I stated before. The first change I would make is that no one knows anything about the Silent Expanse. It is an entirely unknown area to everyone. This removes my issue with the tour guide feeling I got from the quest. As I have stated before, the largest role playing in favor of the Silent Expanse is the mystery around it and that is why it baffles me why they decided to format the quest the way they did. The next one would be that the player is not recruited by Elphaba in Detlas but instead by the King of Ragni. This is a call back to the player's past and presents the importance much better than Elphaba and Aledar ever could. And it finally rewards the player for all their accomplishments. \u201cNo one but you can do this.\u201d It is natural and makes sense in context of the quest. I have many ideas for changes, and these are just examples and if I would list them all out this would enter fanfiction territory. But in my eyes the general idea this quest should strive for is: You have become one of Wynn\u2019s greatest soldiers and now must partake in an adventure into an unknown mysterious land that has not been seen by the eyes of man for centuries to find out what is hiding behind the mountains of Wynn. I am not writing this out of spite. I love this game and I want to see it improve and this is just one of the factors where I see a lot of room for improvement, and I hope that one day these quests reach the potential that they hold.

Closing Remarks Hey everyone, thank you so much for reading yet another publication of mine. I was so excited to finally showcase work that wasn\u2019t mine. Karapandza sent me his draft a few weeks ago and I loved it. A HUGE thank you to him for his contribution this time. I hope he\u2019ll consider more amazing topics in the future. Another big thank you to BeGruent for volunteering to write the Spirit updates section. He\u2019s been hosting a number of events lately, so it\u2019s only fitting he\u2019d want to talk about all of them with you.

Crazy to think this game has been around a whole decade now. It\u2019s changed a lot since those early days (RIP my pre 1.14 Fierte that went into the void). As of right now, it\u2019s unclear whether or not there will be any in-game celebration for this, but for now you can check out Salted\u2019s post on the Forums for some fun BTS pictures over the years. Check it out Here ! Let\u2019s round off this section with all of last month\u2019s promotions, shall we? Vampellao, Silent__Boss, _Ein_Wolf_, ___Apollo__, Long_tata, GamingProf, LordXaverius, Waiter1986, SaintEnder, IndomDoggo, MagischeTaube, ZoSo, Exhinder2295, Fire_209, and CrispperPlanet were all promoted to Sorcerer. Have fun climbing the rest of that ladder! iThought and OverFears were both promoted to Artificer for their efforts in warring and cabinet work respectively. Great work guys! Last, but certainly not least, a HUGE congrats to EchoLuu ! n her promotion to Titan. She has been dedicating so much effort into our warring scene and massively improving her skills as an economiser (all that on top of being an extremely cool guild member in general). I can\u2019t wait to see what else you\u2019ll do! Congrats to everyone who was recently promoted! I always look forward to seeing new names up here, but having a few big promotions really sweetens the deal.","title":"Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5"},{"location":"vol10/#whats-in-the-cupboard-ano-cabinet-review","text":"","title":"What\u2019s in the Cupboard?: ANO Cabinet Review"},{"location":"vol10/#spirits","text":"","title":"Spirits"},{"location":"vol10/#written-by-begruent","text":"Hey Titan\u2019s Valor, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite penguin, BeGruent. This time I will be the one that tells you what has been going on in Titan\u2019s Spirit since last edition. First of all, we had OverFears hosting his first event, Jackbox, which is a collection of games like Push the Button, Monster Seeking Monster, or Survive the Internet. Shortly after that he hosted two additional events, Risk and Minecraft Bingo. Risk is a strategy game where you have to attack your opponents and claim territories. Most of you should know Minecraft Bingo. For everyone that doesn\u2019t here\u2019s how it works: you get a 5x5 sheet and complete a row. The left image shows an example from the practicing round. But there wasn\u2019t only normal bingo, there was also Lockout and Manhunt. While Manhunt is normal bingo with the addition of one team having to kill all players before any other team wins, Lockout is different. Their whole bingo sheet needs to be completed, and as soon as a task is done it\u2019s locked for every team. The goal here is to get the most tasks done, as you see in the right image. Comparison between lockout and normal bingo Similar to Minecraft Bingo, I, BeGruent , made a sequel to my first ever event, Wynncraft Bingo. While last time I made it a Lockout, this time it was normal bingo. Additionally, instead of having 1 week to complete all tasks the participants only had 24 hours. Congratulations to the winners, which were Geb , who got the reward for the first row, linnyflower , who got the reward for being the first and only one to get every task done, and Crisperplanet , who got rewards for not only being the first one to complete 2 rows, but one for 3 and 4 row as well! Last but not least, our friends in [AVO] hosted an amazing Scavenger Hunt event over in Adonis, where you had to find a location using an image, similar to the Geoguesser event that Llamas hosted a while ago. Even though it was pretty difficult, [ANO] managed to secure 3 of 5 rewards. Geb once again took first place, BlueTheSniper got second, and Aemor secured 4th place. Huge congrats to all of you! That should wrap up the event section for this edition, have fun reading through the rest! If you ever feel the urge to make an event by yourself, don\u2019t hesitate to join the Spirit Cabinet!

This publication is probably the most routine thing that goes on in this cabinet (no shade to my fellow Brilliance members, I jest). The good news is that KidOfCubes is working on a systematic recreation of Wynncraft. If all goes well, it should be similar to Wynncraft but entirely open source. He\u2019ll be releasing a trailer for the project once it\u2019s completed, so look out for that in the (not so) near future. In worse news, anode, our war count mod, seems to be causing crash issues with Wynntils, so our Brilliance team is working to resolve that. There may be a new version of anode soon, so anyone participating in Ocean Trials will want to look out for that if a new version is needed. Still working on the fix :p.

When I think about what makes the Silent Expanse interesting, I immediately go to one thought. The mystery. And this is what both a Journey Beyond & a Journey Further can use best to their advantage. There is no area on Wynncraft that sheds any drop of semblance to the Silent Expanse. It is completely unique and mysterious. Before doing A Journey Beyond the player only gets a snippet or two of what is behind the gates of the mines. Without any outside knowledge the player does not know anything about what they are venturing into. But all of this mystery is completely lost by one thing. Aledar just simply already knows everything. This is my largest gripe with both quests. It makes them feel less like an adventure into an unknown land and more like a tour guide. The player does not experience the mysteries and wonders of this new land naturally, they are just told what certain things are and how they function. My next point of critique is the factor of importance. This is the first level 100 quest the player can do and throughout the quests one is told repeatedly that this mission is important, but I never got that feeling and I think this stems from one single thing. The people who are telling you this: Elphaba and Aledar. The player has interacted with Elphaba once before in the quest Reclaiming the House and in the case of Aledar the player has not seen him since the tutorial. These are great callbacks to the player's past experiences and encounters but in my eyes are not capable of presenting the importance of the mission. Since in my case I had completely forgotten who both are. But importance is also not present in a particular part of the quest: The player being chosen for the mission. At this point, the player is level 100, incredibly powerful and has been on a lot of adventures (if one decides to do a lot of the quests) yet for some reason you are never chosen to go on this mission. You randomly stumble into a room that plans this great adventure. This is a large missed opportunity to reward the player for reaching level 100 by specifically choosing them for their great feats and accomplishments. I still have one minor point I would like to add but that is not as large as the others. Simply the addition of a completely new element. In the first third of the quest after failing to defeat Black Geist the player goes to a Blacksmith for help. And he introduces a new Element. I do not have an issue with a new Element exclusive to the Silent Expanse, on the contrary, I think this would be an interesting idea but, in the quest, so little is done with it. After defeating the Black Geist, it is completely forgotten and not utilized again (the Wynncraft team may do more with this with the eventual release of Dern but in the current state of the game the Element of Darkness does not add anything). These two quests have the highest potential in the entire game and that is why it is so disappointing to me to see how they ended up. These would be some examples of my most simple suggestions that I believe would go a long way in improving the quests whilst fixing the issues I stated before. The first change I would make is that no one knows anything about the Silent Expanse. It is an entirely unknown area to everyone. This removes my issue with the tour guide feeling I got from the quest. As I have stated before, the largest role playing in favor of the Silent Expanse is the mystery around it and that is why it baffles me why they decided to format the quest the way they did. The next one would be that the player is not recruited by Elphaba in Detlas but instead by the King of Ragni. This is a call back to the player's past and presents the importance much better than Elphaba and Aledar ever could. And it finally rewards the player for all their accomplishments. \u201cNo one but you can do this.\u201d It is natural and makes sense in context of the quest. I have many ideas for changes, and these are just examples and if I would list them all out this would enter fanfiction territory. But in my eyes the general idea this quest should strive for is: You have become one of Wynn\u2019s greatest soldiers and now must partake in an adventure into an unknown mysterious land that has not been seen by the eyes of man for centuries to find out what is hiding behind the mountains of Wynn. I am not writing this out of spite. I love this game and I want to see it improve and this is just one of the factors where I see a lot of room for improvement, and I hope that one day these quests reach the potential that they hold.","title":"Written by karapandza"},{"location":"vol10/#member-shout-of-the-publication","text":"ohza , because he\u2019s cool :D Trivia Fact A coffee tree takes around 5 years to reach maturity and begin producing fruit.","title":"Member Shout of the Publication"},{"location":"vol10/#closing-remarks","text":"Hey everyone, thank you so much for reading yet another publication of mine.

This one had participants hiding in the sprawling Karoc Quarry. Congrats to our champion hiders kebabdoner, Aemor, IApprove , and Marraino , who are walking away a tad richer for their skills! OverFears attempted to host a Wynncraft Bingo event, but unforeseen technical problems have delayed the festivities. The new date and time are coming up very soon (or perhaps already passed by the time this comes out), so make sure to continue looking at #events for updates if you\u2019re interested in participating. These are a fun way to get to know people with a potential prize in store if you do well, so I highly encourage our newer members to give it a try! Also coming up soon, [ATVA] is hosting a Wynncraft Scavenger Hunt that many guilds will be participating in! This is a great way to hang out with people outside of our guild for a change, and there\u2019s a rapidly increasing prize pool to be had by the winners. A separate server has been created to contain all the event details, so if this sounds like something you might want to participate in, the server invite has been posted in #events. Good luck everyone! Hey you! Yes, you there! Does hosting your own event sound like something that interests you? Or maybe you want to collaborate with someone on a new event? Consider applying to Titan\u2019s Spirit today! This is the subsection of our members that plan and host all the events we get to participate in. As a side benefit, participating in a cabinet is more likely to get you promoted in the future. ALL CURRENT MEMBERS are eligible to apply, so there\u2019s nothing holding you back except your imagination! Brilliance Our Brilliance members have had a bit of a lull this month, but we can still get excited for what has been going on in the background (besides this newspaper of course :D ) A few new commands were added to the bot though. You can use the -guildgroup command to group guilds together for use in -alliance stats or plot2 (still need to add this in later) etc. instead of typing out a long list of guild tags. Other conveniences such as -season were added to help with -r range queries so you don't need to compute the days offset every time you want to find seasonal data. Additionally, we overhauled our war tracking web server to be written in Rust and using the main SQL database. The builders amongst us have once again been progressing on our guild housing. The inside of the castle is no longer being neglected\u2013for the moment anyway. andrew: don't forget to add recent brilliance project The Backrooms 2.0 Cool banners Looks pretty good from out here We\u2019re always looking for new members too!

Anyone participating in Ocean Trials this season had better start racking up those FFA wars if you want some of that sweet, sweet LE. A quick note for Ocean Trials participants: Anode, the mod we use to track wars, has received an update. If you haven\u2019t already done so, please make sure you update to the newer version if you want to continue participating in Ocean Trials. Wars completed not using Anode will not count towards your end of season total. There\u2019s also been a change to the map mid-season. While this doesn\u2019t affect our claim at all, it does affect the claim of our allies. Anyone interested in ranking up by warring should pay attention to any future map changes, especially those interested in learning eco. Good news on the organization side of things: our list of war builds is migrating and evolving! Get excited! We now have a forum in the Military section of the Discord that will be the future home of all our current war builds. The hope is that not only will they be updated more regularly as the meta continues to change over time, but also provide better instructions for each build to those of you who are learning to war for the first time. Much more user friendly than the old war builds document! If you have questions about the new system or about the builds themselves, feel free to ask questions in #military-chat Main Stage: The Breaking Point Reviewed \ud83e\udea8 Written by karapandza After looking at why both A Journey Beyond and a Journey Further fail to serve their purpose, I want to look at how The Breaking Point not only fulfills what it set out to do, but also excels in many ways and thus has become my personal favorite Wynncraft quest. This piece will be a bit shorter since I do not have as many thoughts surrounding this quest but nonetheless, it is still interesting to analyze. There are 2 factors that lead to this: gameplay and story/dialogue, and how these interact with the player. I also want to preface all of this with the fact that The Breaking Point is one of the newest quests and of course can take advantage of all the knowledge and the skills that the Wynncraft team has developed over these many years. The gameplay in this quest is simply brilliant. Each section is fun and memorable. Oftentimes quests end up just consisting of the player getting resources and bringing them to an NPC. Even though this quest has many such moments they are surrounded by interesting and creative parkour and fun combat. I never got bored whilst playing; every section clicked with me. None of the gameplay is repetitive and this can be attributed to the smart use of teleportation. Even though I did not touch on this in my last piece, the multiple and rapid use of teleports in A Journey Beyond helped the quest feel even less like a proper adventure, which it should strive to be. I am not against the use of teleportation in quests, but it must be done intelligently to properly fit in. Of all the quests that I have done, The Breaking Point utilizes teleportation and fast travel perfectly. It is used at the right intervals where it does not feel overused, and within the context of the quest, it makes perfect sense (I would like to add that Aledar's use of teleportation also makes sense but my issue with it is that is simply used too often for such short distances). The gameplay is fun, creative, and engaging. This is what all quests should aim to achieve. What I love most about his quest is how it makes everything you have done feel even more important. The dragon you once got out of the vaults of Thanos led to something larger. Even the two Corkus quests led to something larger. But it also gives closure. All your actions in the Dwarves and Doguns quest line really meant something. You as the player caused change for the better. You affected these people. Often the continuity of Wynncraft to me at least is forgotten but especially here you are reminded that time is always passing and the lives of the people you saved are advancing. I cannot praise this quest enough for how it highlights all the great tasks the player achieved by then. Since the addition of the multiple-choice dialogue system, I was personally never a huge fan of it. But once again this quest uses it brilliantly. The Player is so involved in the dialogue whereas in many other quests you end up feeling like a spectator, only partially being involved in what is being discussed. The story once again is fun and leads you to different diverse places. From the icy caves of Molten Heights to a small research lab on the island of Corkus. Watching different NPCs from such different quests and places interact is so enjoyable. It displays that Wynn is a living place with people who need help from others from kilometers away. I love this quest. It takes full advantage of everything Wynncraft has to offer today. It connects people that are so far apart because of what the player did. It highlights the importance of all the actions one has taken thus far. And it makes Wynncraft feel alive. I love this quest and I cannot wait for what quests await us in Fruma!

Male cats are more likely to be left-pawed, while female cats are more likely to be right-pawed. Closing Remarks If you made it this far, thank you! Writing this piece was something I kept putting off because I\u2019ve been busy with IRL things and my free time is mostly spent decompressing from that. It leaves me with not very much creative energy at the end of the day. But we got it done! A very special thank you to karapandza for another great article.

Other conveniences such as -season were added to help with -r range queries so you don't need to compute the days offset every time you want to find seasonal data.

If you haven\u2019t already done so, please make sure you update to the newer version if you want to continue participating in Ocean Trials. Wars completed not using Anode will not count towards your end of season total. There\u2019s also been a change to the map mid-season.

Anyone interested in ranking up by warring should pay attention to any future map changes, especially those interested in learning eco. Good news on the organization side of things: our list of war builds is migrating and evolving! Get excited! We now have a forum in the Military section of the Discord that will be the future home of all our current war builds. The hope is that not only will they be updated more regularly as the meta continues to change over time, but also provide better instructions for each build to those of you who are learning to war for the first time.

This piece will be a bit shorter since I do not have as many thoughts surrounding this quest but nonetheless, it is still interesting to analyze. There are 2 factors that lead to this: gameplay and story/dialogue, and how these interact with the player. I also want to preface all of this with the fact that The Breaking Point is one of the newest quests and of course can take advantage of all the knowledge and the skills that the Wynncraft team has developed over these many years. The gameplay in this quest is simply brilliant. Each section is fun and memorable. Oftentimes quests end up just consisting of the player getting resources and bringing them to an NPC. Even though this quest has many such moments they are surrounded by interesting and creative parkour and fun combat. I never got bored whilst playing; every section clicked with me. None of the gameplay is repetitive and this can be attributed to the smart use of teleportation. Even though I did not touch on this in my last piece, the multiple and rapid use of teleports in A Journey Beyond helped the quest feel even less like a proper adventure, which it should strive to be. I am not against the use of teleportation in quests, but it must be done intelligently to properly fit in. Of all the quests that I have done, The Breaking Point utilizes teleportation and fast travel perfectly. It is used at the right intervals where it does not feel overused, and within the context of the quest, it makes perfect sense (I would like to add that Aledar's use of teleportation also makes sense but my issue with it is that is simply used too often for such short distances). The gameplay is fun, creative, and engaging. This is what all quests should aim to achieve. What I love most about his quest is how it makes everything you have done feel even more important. The dragon you once got out of the vaults of Thanos led to something larger. Even the two Corkus quests led to something larger. But it also gives closure. All your actions in the Dwarves and Doguns quest line really meant something. You as the player caused change for the better. You affected these people. Often the continuity of Wynncraft to me at least is forgotten but especially here you are reminded that time is always passing and the lives of the people you saved are advancing. I cannot praise this quest enough for how it highlights all the great tasks the player achieved by then. Since the addition of the multiple-choice dialogue system, I was personally never a huge fan of it. But once again this quest uses it brilliantly. The Player is so involved in the dialogue whereas in many other quests you end up feeling like a spectator, only partially being involved in what is being discussed. The story once again is fun and leads you to different diverse places. From the icy caves of Molten Heights to a small research lab on the island of Corkus. Watching different NPCs from such different quests and places interact is so enjoyable. It displays that Wynn is a living place with people who need help from others from kilometers away. I love this quest. It takes full advantage of everything Wynncraft has to offer today. It connects people that are so far apart because of what the player did. It highlights the importance of all the actions one has taken thus far. And it makes Wynncraft feel alive. I love this quest and I cannot wait for what quests await us in Fruma!","title":"Written by karapandza"},{"location":"vol11/#member-shout-of-the-publication","text":"DannYTop123 , for notable activity lately.

This is definitely not the third time this volume has been written . I hope all of Salted\u2019s patch notes haven\u2019t made you completely sick of the Hero Beta yet, cause we\u2019ll be getting to that shortly. But first, the usual. Let\u2019s not keep y\u2019all in my intro any longer! Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5 First up, promotions! I love this part because I get to talk about the guild members that have really stepped it up recently. There\u2019s a good handful this go around since this has been rewritten so many times . Niel1299_TW, RowansWorld, ThrowMusket, Galassia98, explosivegamer25, TM20, Dr_san, wabbalubbadubdub, vxzzy, Gushh, iBug, and Varuhkt have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Additionally, Aemor and Asoart have made the jump to Artificer! Congrats everyone, and let\u2019s get some new names up here soon! As I\u2019m sure all of us know by now, the Hero Beta is available for anyone who has Hero or Champion rank. At the time of writing, there are 4 classes that are playable (sad no shaman), and new patches are coming regularly until the release of the new update. If you\u2019re able to play and haven\u2019t yet, I highly recommend giving some of the features a spin! I\u2019m also fairly certain most people know this too, but the SMP with our friends over in Adonis has been out for about a month now make your bets now for whether or not SMP will be dead by the time this comes out. It\u2019s a 1.19 vanilla server and is just a fun space for alliance members to hang outside of Wynn. If for some reason you\u2019re not in the Adonis discord, make sure you use the invite link in #guild-info and join the shenanigans (and definitely not just so I have more people to count with)! Staying with news from Adonis for another moment, ESI members planned a Wynnguesser (same concept as Geoguesser, but using the Wynncraft map) event. Participants were given either images or short video clips of a location in game, and were asked to provide approximate coordinates within 30 seconds. 3 of the top slots were held by ANO members, so congrats to Cal, Geb, and Micah! A fun surprise recently was another Crab Game event hosted by LaMDaKiS! Me being at work at the time, I couldn\u2019t personally attend, but Crab Game is always a popular choice amongst guild members (and even people outside ANO), so of course it was a success. Make sure you grab the events role so you don\u2019t miss any surprise events like this one! editor's note: Raw finished the medal command. -profile <username> to see your medals \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f, if you've gotten one from the award ceremony. Adonis End Photo taken by Ohza I got one shot by the Nova Dragon's ability (full netherite etc.) Aezuh Perspective Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f I want to start this section off by giving a massive congrats to ChristmasBear for passing the strategist test! The test isn\u2019t as simple as one might think, and new strats do not come by often. Nice job dude! It has been a few weeks at this point, but it\u2019s still notable to mention our 5th place standing at the end of Season 6! This is higher than the previous season, so it\u2019s awesome to see our war teams more active this time around. LaMDaKiS also came on top in Ocean Trials, our seasonal event in which you can earn LE for warring! Make sure you grab the role in #military-info if you\u2019re interested in participating this season (or in any future season). Our Season 7 reclaim of the ocean went smoothly. However, we have 3 new territories in our claim this season: Jofash Docks, Aldorei Valley West Entrance, and Light Forest West Lower; that officially makes ours a 30 territory claim instead of 27! As always, if you don\u2019t have the military role and would like it, just ask any council member for access! Main Stage: Hero Beta Patches \ud83c\udf0e With multiple patches having been released at this point, I wanted to get some of the guild members\u2019 thoughts on the content we\u2019ve seen thus far, and some predictions for the future. Most of the members interviewed this round have Hero+ rank and have played the beta, but not everyone was! Overall, ANO members seem to be excited for the final release of Spellbound, but let\u2019s see what our thoughts are on the patches! Have you played on the Hero Beta yet? Which classes? My thoughts : I\u2019ve played on Warrior and only really looked at the skill tree on Mage TM20 : Yes, on Mage and Archer. LaMDaKiS : Yes, on Archer, and a bit on Warrior and Mage. Now that \u2158 classes are out, what are your overall thoughts of the update so far? My thoughts : I think it\u2019ll take time for me to really appreciate the new stuff; right now it feels like too many dramatic changes at once, but anything less wouldn\u2019t be worthy of a 2.0 release Ugastag : I really like the variety they are providing with the archetypes making all the builds more diverse. TheZeldaBoi : The ability tree seems cool, the agility and defense changes don\u2019t. What class do you think you\u2019ll play on first when the final update drops? My thoughts : I\u2019m definitely going to start a new class, and it\u2019ll probably be either assassin or warrior (I\u2019m biased okay). Rowans_World : When the update releases on main servers I\u2019ll play Mage then Archer, and I\u2019ll probably have a 105 Warrior and Shaman by then too. Viirns : Maybe Archer first because I enjoy that the most. Which feature/piece of content are you most hopeful for or excited to play with? My thoughts : I\u2019m excited to check out the new quests! I\u2019ve been avoiding them until the final release so I get the best experience with any lore-based content. TakenEleven : Funny vertical teleport, heal immunity, etc. Basically fun stuff with Mage and Shaman. TheZeldaBoi : I'm excited for the new raid and ability tree. Which feature/piece of content has your biggest criticism? My thoughts : Spellspam builds are going to work very differently, and with the nerfs to intelligence, I think spellspam is going to be significantly less effective. LaMDaKiS : One of the 3 quests is a movie like, 70% is just cutscenes. TM20 : The ability tree is very overwhelming. How do you imagine this will impact the guild community? My thoughts : Because of the new archetypes and the new damage system, warring will require completely new builds. Also, I imagine many veteran players will want to return to check out the new update. Rowans_World : I don\u2019t really think it\u2019ll impact the guild, we\u2019re more of a community that plays Wynncraft together than a community dependent on Wynncraft. Ugastag : With the new archetypes, it'll obviously greatly affect the war meta with all the new spells and the update will definitely draw back veterans back into the game, flooding guilds. How do you think the build meta will change after the update releases (specifically with the change in the mana and combat systems)? My thoughts : I think heavy melee builds will dominate the meta because you\u2019re able to create a wider variety of melee builds across the new archetypes (RIP spellspam warrior my beloved). Viirns : The meta is really impossible to predict, as there are so many new ways to play; it's not gonna be spells vs. melee anymore, so I don't know about the meta. TakenEleven : I think we are going to see 1 build way better than the rest in the meta for each mythic weapon in a certain archetype (sob no more variety). Any other thoughts? My thoughts : I hope we see a better mana revert before final release, but I doubt I\u2019ll get one. LaMDaKiS : TakenEleven : wynn are you high btw Ugastag : Dogs Viirns : I like this update, and hope it brings a new life to wynncraft, maybe puts it back at the top of the list of games to play. So there you have it! Lots of different thoughts and opinions, but overall pretty positive. If you haven\u2019t checked out the Hero Beta recently (and are able to of course), I would recommend it!

Niel1299_TW, RowansWorld, ThrowMusket, Galassia98, explosivegamer25, TM20, Dr_san, wabbalubbadubdub, vxzzy, Gushh, iBug, and Varuhkt have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Additionally, Aemor and Asoart have made the jump to Artificer! Congrats everyone, and let\u2019s get some new names up here soon! As I\u2019m sure all of us know by now, the Hero Beta is available for anyone who has Hero or Champion rank. At the time of writing, there are 4 classes that are playable (sad no shaman), and new patches are coming regularly until the release of the new update. If you\u2019re able to play and haven\u2019t yet, I highly recommend giving some of the features a spin! I\u2019m also fairly certain most people know this too, but the SMP with our friends over in Adonis has been out for about a month now make your bets now for whether or not SMP will be dead by the time this comes out. It\u2019s a 1.19 vanilla server and is just a fun space for alliance members to hang outside of Wynn. If for some reason you\u2019re not in the Adonis discord, make sure you use the invite link in #guild-info and join the shenanigans (and definitely not just so I have more people to count with)! Staying with news from Adonis for another moment, ESI members planned a Wynnguesser (same concept as Geoguesser, but using the Wynncraft map) event. Participants were given either images or short video clips of a location in game, and were asked to provide approximate coordinates within 30 seconds. 3 of the top slots were held by ANO members, so congrats to Cal, Geb, and Micah! A fun surprise recently was another Crab Game event hosted by LaMDaKiS! Me being at work at the time, I couldn\u2019t personally attend, but Crab Game is always a popular choice amongst guild members (and even people outside ANO), so of course it was a success. Make sure you grab the events role so you don\u2019t miss any surprise events like this one! editor's note: Raw finished the medal command. -profile <username> to see your medals \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f, if you've gotten one from the award ceremony.

The test isn\u2019t as simple as one might think, and new strats do not come by often. Nice job dude! It has been a few weeks at this point, but it\u2019s still notable to mention our 5th place standing at the end of Season 6! This is higher than the previous season, so it\u2019s awesome to see our war teams more active this time around. LaMDaKiS also came on top in Ocean Trials, our seasonal event in which you can earn LE for warring! Make sure you grab the role in #military-info if you\u2019re interested in participating this season (or in any future season). Our Season 7 reclaim of the ocean went smoothly. However, we have 3 new territories in our claim this season: Jofash Docks, Aldorei Valley West Entrance, and Light Forest West Lower; that officially makes ours a 30 territory claim instead of 27!

Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5 Starting off, Patch #11 of the Spellbound Hero Beta was released earlier this month. This included the release of Shaman on the beta, plus a bunch of balance patches for assassin, and a handful of bug fixes (because Wynn is such a perfect game with absolutely 0 bugs ) Shaman mains rejoice as your time has come to test out the new content! Photo taken by Ugastag Beta is currently open to all players. Thanks to Ugastag, Biblonko, and BlueTheSniper, Titan\u2019s Spirit has had quite the revival recently! With events such as mob hunts, Gartic Phone, item retrievals, and a variety of minigames, there\u2019s lots to go around. Events are a fun way to bring guild members together both inside and out of Wynn. If you\u2019re interested in attending events in the future, make sure you grab the events role in #guild-info so you get a ping when we announce new events! To add to that, we had an extra special event recently: Item bomb party! Thanks to Nimbuh, Cal, Halaiksse, and robopig3000, we were able to throw over 200 item bombs in a row (only 1 mythic resulted between over 20 people, big sad)! Personally, I didn\u2019t get much worth mentioning, but I had fun hanging out with everyone! Did you know that BlueTheSniper has his own discord server dedicated to Wynncraft builds? Did you also know that Blue created an exclusive ANO role in his server that automatically grants all Titans Valor members VIP status? Did you want to have access to a huge database of all types of builds that are updated daily by other players? If any of these things sound good to you, make sure you head over to Blue's Builds . My favorite part of the publication has arrived: promotions! There have been quite a few since the last volume so don\u2019t be too alarmed at the length of this list. Lucky32, Hothotrod, BlueTheSniper, bmarci04, CensingMarker51, HadesRPB, CatgirlZyris, OblivionEnjoyer, Masterfuzja, Emeraldglass, ItsEmerald, robopig3000 , and _Constellar have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Habidudi has been promoted to Artificer! Biblonko and Ugastag have been promoted to Titan! A couple of big promotions here, so congratulations to everyone on this list! Hope to see more new names up here next time! Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f While this section might look a bit shorter, smaller in size does not mean decreased importance! Guild season 7 just ended; ANO earned just over 6 million SR points, putting us 6th overall! Congrats to everyone who participated in warring this season. With the season ending, that also means the end of another season of Ocean Trials come and gone! For anyone who doesn\u2019t already know, Ocean Trials is an event we hold every season in which you can war for LE. At the top of the leaderboard this season was none other than GebutterteWurst ! Other honorable mentions were LaMDaKis in 2nd and Callum in 3rd. Hopefully this event will be returning next season after the release of 2.0, but if you want to stay updated on the latest information, make sure you grab the role from #military-info! Main Stage: An Interview with Geb \ud83c\udf0e Recently I had the opportunity to reach out to someone who quickly became a core part of our guild, none other than GebutterteWurst. To celebrate his 1 year anniversary with ANO, I\u2019m doing my best to get this volume released on the exact day (but hey I\u2019m only human and it might be late, let\u2019s see if I can do it). Geb and I haven\u2019t had much of an opportunity to establish much connection, which is why I thought it only fitting to send him some thought-provoking questions \u2013 this way both myself and all of you can get to know him just a bit better! So without further adieu, let\u2019s learn something about one of our newest councilors! Text in italics are my own thoughts or responses. What\u2019s your favorite thing to do on Wynn? \u201cFrom the moment I first joined Wynncraft, I have really enjoyed doing quests, and still do now, even after having completed every quest over 10 times. Just recently, I did all the quests on another class in an optimal order to minimize walking distance, which was incredibly fun.\u201d Quests are one of my favorite parts of Wynn too, even ROL3. It\u2019s a shame you can get through them all so fast and new quests don\u2019t come often. How has your experience in ANO been and how does it compare to other guilds you\u2019ve been in? \u201cMy time in ANO has always been filled with lots of joy and fun; even in hard times or when I have to deal with people or topics I don't particularly like, I tell myself that dealing with hardships is part of the journey.\u201d How has ANO enhanced (or detracted from, though seems unlikely) your time playing Wynncraft? \u201cThere is too much to mention here, but probably the biggest thing is ANO events. Besides events being very fun, they also made me rich, leading to what is probably more than half of my net worth being from some event.\u201d I am definitely not taking notes here and saving them for later. For anyone wondering how to make money quickly, events are fun and almost always have sizable LE prizes! editor's note: android_zx (former member) doubled my net worth. Then the llamas doubled that again. What made you want to join ANO in the first place? \u201cThere isn't any special story to tell here; like most people I saw an advertisement. I think it was a shout from Cal and I decided to apply.\u201d My decision to apply was a bit more complex than this, but that\u2019s a story for another time. You\u2019ve been in the guild about a year now. What\u2019s one word you\u2019d use to describe ANO? \u201cNonchalant.\u201d As one of the newest members of parliament, is there anything you thought would change/be different after becoming councilor? Or are your experiences close to what you thought they would be? \u201cIt's mostly like I expected it would be \u2013 a lot of things to do, some responsibility, but also a lot of fun.\u201d I was hoping you\u2019d say fun! That\u2019s the most important part! What\u2019s your favorite thing about being in ANO so far? \u201cIt really doesn't boil down to one singular thing; everything about ANO is great and I love that.\u201d If you could change one thing about ANO or the guild community as a whole, what would it be? \u201cI feel like some people in the guild community should remember that at the end of the day, Wynncraft is still just a game and should take it less seriously.\u201d Hard agree, and I think this is true across MMOs as a whole. Some people really like to get worked up over a virtual world I suppose. What other games have you been enjoying recently? Or maybe a hobby outside of gaming altogether? \u201cJust recently I started playing BloonsTD Battles 2 again. I had played it for a while just after launch, but back then it had a lot of issues. Luckily, most of the major issues got resolved and now it's actually a lot of fun!\u201d Is this my call to try BloonsTD Battles? Maybe. I do love Bloons as a franchise. I never got your input on the 2.0 update and the Beta in my other interviews. Summarize your thoughts/concerns/questions/et cetera here. \u201cThe new quests are cool, even if some of them are more movie-like, such as RoL 3. A lot of the abilities are still very unbalanced and some are completely broken, and the new raid is cool but a lot easier than I expected it to be. I really like the new Kandon-Beda and Nesaak designs, even if they somewhat remind me of EO. I know they redesigned Thesead as well, but I have yet to go there. I guess we will see how things go when they release the update soon!\u201d And the beta should be available to all players by the time this comes out! GOGOGO check it out! Is there anything else you wanted to mention about Wynn, Titans Valor, or anything else? \u201cAmong Us\u201d I looked at a trash can and I thought \u201cthat\u2019s a bit sussy!!!!\u201d (iykyk) And thus concludes this interview! If there\u2019s anything this one has taught me, it\u2019s that Geb is a pretty chill dude, so don\u2019t be afraid to say hi in chat! Special thank you to Geb for letting me send him some questions. Member Shout of the Publication Nimbuh , for contributing over 100 bombs to our bomb party recently Trivia Fact \u2728 Messier 51, or the Whirlpool Galaxy, was the first celestial object to be classified as a spiral galaxy. Here\u2019s an image I took of it back in July! Closing Remarks As always, thank you, reader, for making it down to this part. Y\u2019all\u2019s enjoyment of the Times is what keeps me writing and bringing you the latest ANO and Wynn news. I\u2019m hoping 2.0 will spur some fun prompts for our main stage, but I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s coming down the pipeline! As always, thank you to Aezuh, editor for the times, and to my fellow Brilliance members who usually end up proofreading for spelling/grammar mistakes as an excuse to dunk on me. If there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to see in the Times in the future, feel free to drop me a DM so we can talk!

Did you also know that Blue created an exclusive ANO role in his server that automatically grants all Titans Valor members VIP status? Did you want to have access to a huge database of all types of builds that are updated daily by other players? If any of these things sound good to you, make sure you head over to Blue's Builds . My favorite part of the publication has arrived: promotions! There have been quite a few since the last volume so don\u2019t be too alarmed at the length of this list. Lucky32, Hothotrod, BlueTheSniper, bmarci04, CensingMarker51, HadesRPB, CatgirlZyris, OblivionEnjoyer, Masterfuzja, Emeraldglass, ItsEmerald, robopig3000 , and _Constellar have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Habidudi has been promoted to Artificer! Biblonko and Ugastag have been promoted to Titan! A couple of big promotions here, so congratulations to everyone on this list! Hope to see more new names up here next time!","title":"Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5"},{"location":"vol5/#military-updates","text":"While this section might look a bit shorter, smaller in size does not mean decreased importance!

Or should I say Titan Times, the best place to get your fill of guild activity and thoughtful insights into all things Wynn! Some fun promotions, a good bit of trivia, and the anticipated results of the survey posted not long ago. Let\u2019s hop in! Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5 Ice is the guy in blue dyed armor To start, I want to acknowledge the long term hiatus of ANO\u2019s founder, IceResistance. We\u2019ll miss you Ice, and wish the best for you in your endeavors. Two years will go by in the blink of an eye! 2.0 was finally released between my last publication, and it\u2019s been so much fun playing around with the new features (though we\u2019ll see what the rest of the guild thinks in a bit !!). Now is a great time to start new classes and experience the game in a whole new way! I hope you all are having fun with it so far. Also, The second annual Festival of the Bonfire is ongoing for the next month or so! Come check out the decorated Detlas, have a go at the Battle of the Bonfire minigame, and exclusive Bonfire crates (and Spirit crates, but they do not contain new cosmetics this year, only ones from the Festival of the Spirits last October) are on sale now! Crates can also be obtained by completing daily objectives and doing your guild objectives. There\u2019s never been a better incentive for doing your guild objective! I always love the seasonal festivals, so I hope you get a chance to check things out! There\u2019s been quite a few events recently! BlueTheSniper has hosted a variety of minigame events including Tactical Gaggle and Spectral Zone. Additionally, Ugastag and Biblonko hosted an event to create a brand new guild advertisement to be used in the Wynncraft discord server. I had fun creating my submission, but big congratulations to 4NZ1K for creating the best advertisement! If you\u2019re interested in participating in future events, make sure you grab the role in #guild-info, or if you think you might like to help plan events in the future, consider applying to Titan\u2019s Spirit (the tickets for which can also be found in #guild-info)! There was also an event over in Adonis hosted by ESI, a Mafia style game with professions involved! Citizen players had to create certain crafted items, while the mafia members tried to avoid detection. I was unfortunately unable to attend, but many of our members made it on the leaderboard including Callum, GebutterteWurst, RawGamingYT, LaMDaKiS, and ChristmasBear! There\u2019s also an ongoing event happening in Adonis (it's finished now)! It\u2019s a Parkour Spiral made by our very own Constellar! Lots of LE up for grabs with this event, so I hope everyone who tries it out has lots of fun. Parkour Leaderboard ScientificSnake, T1hunna, Aviararo, Seaskipper, Chinos, Garr, AWornOutShoe, 50ish, CleansingFlames , and Patia_ have all been promoted to Sorcerer! ccanonn, Jk725, xXMemelord69420, PenStick , and _1Fps have been promoted to Sorcerer! Flipiik has been promoted to Sorcerer! Lucky32, BlueTheSniper and aFireblaze (wb fireblaze btw) have been promoted to Artificer! Congratulations to all our recent promotees, and I hope to see some new names up here soon! Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f Starting off, our Season 8 reclaim of the ocean went well! Our claim this season is very similar to that we\u2019ve had for many seasons now, so not much to report on there. Let\u2019s make this another great season for the books! Our military alliance, Cucumber Company (Cucumber was archived. The new alliance name is called \"Smtn else\"), has seen a few changes back in the beginning of the season. Gang of Fools [FOOL] has left and betrayed the alliance, but we\u2019re happy to welcome Paladins United [PUN], The Simple Ones [ILQ], and Terralune [UTL] to our wider guild family! Season 5 of Ocean Trials starts. It's a seasonal event in which you can earn LE for participating in wars! You don\u2019t have to be a certain rank or have a certain build to participate. You will, however, be required to install and use a mod for the duration of the season in order to have a valid entry. We\u2019re trying something new this season, so there\u2019s bound to be a few hiccups, but it should help us out immensely if all goes well. If you want more information, make sure you have the military role (if you do not and would like it, please let a council member know) and grab the Ocean Trials role from #military-info! Rounding out this section, I want to congratulate Lucky32 and aFireBlaze for passing the strategist test! As a reminder, any member who is currently Captain and (and Artificer) has at least 300 total wars can attempt the strategist test. Main Stage: ANO\u2019s Thoughts on The Spellbound Update \ud83c\udf0e I know a lot of my publications have talked about something to do with the 2.0 update, but this is (at least most likely) the last you\u2019ll hear about it from me! Now that the update has been out for a while for all players, I wanted to get a sense of what the members of Titans Valor thought. Most of you (unless you\u2019re very new, in which case hi new people, hope you like it here) saw the survey I posted a few weeks ago, and I wanted to share the results here! I am happy to report that I received a total of 41 responses (shame to the other approximately 50 of you who chose not to respond, luckily I kept responses anonymous so y\u2019all are safe this time\u2026). I\u2019m also going to share some of my favorite responses to the last question in the survey because some were quite entertaining. Without further adieu, the results! What is your main class? More than half of us are playing on either Warrior or Mage (they were very close) after the update now. Seems like this is very similar to before the update, we\u2019re still unoriginal! What is your main class\u2019s combat level? Nearly everyone has at least 1 class over 100, but a couple of you are still down in the 70-80 range. I see you and I know you\u2019ll be there soon! Leveling has been more fun since the update, I\u2019ve been working on a new class myself recently! What has been your favorite part of the update so far? ANO members overwhelmingly love the new skill tree and class archetypes, but also are enjoying the new Nameless Anomaly raid and the new quests. Personally, new Galleon\u2019s Graveyard is just \\*chef\u2019s kiss\\* so much better. I hope we get more improved dungeon experiences in the future now that we\u2019ve seen what the content team is capable of. What has been your least favorite thing about the update so far? Of course bugs are always the top answer for something like this, but hopefully those will get worked out in time. Lots of people mentioned some form of class rebalancing issue (whether it be the nerfs to Defense and Agility, the fact that Assassin is now pretty useless, or having to choose between high DPS or survivability.) I think the skill tree provided a good start for having varying playstyles in each class, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see changes to it in the future. If you hate it now, hope is not lost! If there\u2019s one thing you could change about the update, what would it be? I got a huge variety of responses here, but most of them were related to specific archetype abilities. Another thing that really stood out was nerfing the enemies in Nexus of Light and The Canyon Colossus, as these are now more difficult to complete than the endgame raid. What has been your favorite archetype to play as overall so far? As a caveat, I know lots of people use builds that cross between multiple archetypes, so I\u2019ve asked people to select the choice that they put the most skill points into. Take the next few questions with a grain of salt! Sharpshooter and Battle Monk come out on top for this one! Nearly all the archetypes were represented here (minus Trickster and Ritualist), so I\u2019m glad to see everyone is finding something to enjoy! Favorite archetype for warring? Oddly enough, most people chose to skip this question, I assume because not everyone who completed the survey are active warriors (which is fine!). For those who did answer though, Fallen was far and away the favorite. Favorite archetype for raids? Paladin and Sharpshooter were both very close! Again, lots of people chose to skip this one. Just goes to show how differently each person enjoys this game! Thoughts on how the update has impacted the marketplace economy? Most of the answers here were about the insane inflation we\u2019ve been seeing lately, and hopes that this will calm down in a few months.I\u2019m definitely seconding that! (mama needs an idol) How would you rate the update on a scale of 1-10? Most of our respondents rated this update between a 7 and 9, which is pretty good! In the follow up question, players mentioned needing a lot of bug fixes and other QOL fixes, but also doing better class rebalancing. And now the fun part\u2026the best responses! \u201cANO is a good guild\u201d I agree \u201cgive me all your stx, this is a threat\u201d It ain\u2019t much but also no \u201cI love what you do here with the Titan Times!

Member Shout of the Publication RawGamingYT , for Bee appreciation post Trivia Fact Since I started writing this before losing power from Hurricane Ian, here\u2019s a hurricane fact: the deadliest Atlantic Hurricane on record is Hurricane Mitch, which devastated Central America in 1998, costing an estimated 11,000 people to lose their lives.

I know these closings feel pretty similar each time, but I always want to reiterate how much your support means to me and keeps me motivated to keep writing for all of you. I know my publication schedule isn\u2019t very consistent, but I try to always make sure I have a good Main Stage segment, which is usually the main reason for delay. If you ever have ideas, feel free to DM me! Or if you think you\u2019d like to help work on the Times in the future, consider submitting an application to Titan\u2019s Brilliance.

We\u2019ll miss you Ice, and wish the best for you in your endeavors. Two years will go by in the blink of an eye! 2.0 was finally released between my last publication, and it\u2019s been so much fun playing around with the new features (though we\u2019ll see what the rest of the guild thinks in a bit !!). Now is a great time to start new classes and experience the game in a whole new way! I hope you all are having fun with it so far. Also, The second annual Festival of the Bonfire is ongoing for the next month or so! Come check out the decorated Detlas, have a go at the Battle of the Bonfire minigame, and exclusive Bonfire crates (and Spirit crates, but they do not contain new cosmetics this year, only ones from the Festival of the Spirits last October) are on sale now! Crates can also be obtained by completing daily objectives and doing your guild objectives. There\u2019s never been a better incentive for doing your guild objective! I always love the seasonal festivals, so I hope you get a chance to check things out! There\u2019s been quite a few events recently! BlueTheSniper has hosted a variety of minigame events including Tactical Gaggle and Spectral Zone. Additionally, Ugastag and Biblonko hosted an event to create a brand new guild advertisement to be used in the Wynncraft discord server. I had fun creating my submission, but big congratulations to 4NZ1K for creating the best advertisement! If you\u2019re interested in participating in future events, make sure you grab the role in #guild-info, or if you think you might like to help plan events in the future, consider applying to Titan\u2019s Spirit (the tickets for which can also be found in #guild-info)! There was also an event over in Adonis hosted by ESI, a Mafia style game with professions involved! Citizen players had to create certain crafted items, while the mafia members tried to avoid detection. I was unfortunately unable to attend, but many of our members made it on the leaderboard including Callum, GebutterteWurst, RawGamingYT, LaMDaKiS, and ChristmasBear! There\u2019s also an ongoing event happening in Adonis (it's finished now)! It\u2019s a Parkour Spiral made by our very own Constellar! Lots of LE up for grabs with this event, so I hope everyone who tries it out has lots of fun. Parkour Leaderboard ScientificSnake, T1hunna, Aviararo, Seaskipper, Chinos, Garr, AWornOutShoe, 50ish, CleansingFlames , and Patia_ have all been promoted to Sorcerer! ccanonn, Jk725, xXMemelord69420, PenStick , and _1Fps have been promoted to Sorcerer! Flipiik has been promoted to Sorcerer! Lucky32, BlueTheSniper and aFireblaze (wb fireblaze btw) have been promoted to Artificer!

Our claim this season is very similar to that we\u2019ve had for many seasons now, so not much to report on there. Let\u2019s make this another great season for the books! Our military alliance, Cucumber Company (Cucumber was archived. The new alliance name is called \"Smtn else\"), has seen a few changes back in the beginning of the season. Gang of Fools [FOOL] has left and betrayed the alliance, but we\u2019re happy to welcome Paladins United [PUN], The Simple Ones [ILQ], and Terralune [UTL] to our wider guild family! Season 5 of Ocean Trials starts. It's a seasonal event in which you can earn LE for participating in wars! You don\u2019t have to be a certain rank or have a certain build to participate. You will, however, be required to install and use a mod for the duration of the season in order to have a valid entry. We\u2019re trying something new this season, so there\u2019s bound to be a few hiccups, but it should help us out immensely if all goes well. If you want more information, make sure you have the military role (if you do not and would like it, please let a council member know) and grab the Ocean Trials role from #military-info!

Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5 (Snazz) Patch 2.0.1 has been released with a ton of new content. The new Corrupted Galleon\u2019s Graveyard dungeon was added to the Forgery \ud83d\udc38, allowing for a higher mythic chance by completing all eight dungeons. In addition, the Underworld Crypt dungeon bossfight got some love with a new revamp of Charon. Finally, the Breaking Point Quest was added for the Canyon Colossus.

You can read the original post here: https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/work-on-fruma-is-ongoing.305082/ Since Christmas is just around the corner, we have temporarily added the 25/7 CHRISTMAS voice channel with a bot that plays Christmas music for 25 (?) hours a day. Our resident Llamas Ugastag and Biblonko as well as BlueTheSniper have been cooking up plenty of events. Congrats to those who won the Wynncraft trivia event: Callum, GebutterteWurst, Snazz, xKaerynn, Aemor, RotemRotem, EchoLuu, and CensingMarker51. We also had hide and seek in Troms and Lusuco. The llamas used zones on the map which would close over time to keep things moving. Congrats to ScientificSnake, GebutterteWurst, Asoart, Snazz, Assassin420, and 4NZ1K for winning! Blue has also hosted a variety of events including Mineplex Minigames and other minigames. Thank you everyone else for participating! In addition we have the upcoming CHRIMUH SKIN COMPETITION! Dress up in your most festive outfit to win rewards! Find out more in the events channel on Discord.

Congrats to Mavely, robopig3000, _EliteNightmare, withstands, add1kted, 1Fps, xKaerynn, Skoneez, and NothingButBread_ for winning! Meanwhile, in Adonis, we have a couple more events to cover. For ESI\u2019s Trick or Treat event, there were tasks to complete to earn points for prizes. Among the winners, in ANO we had Snazz \ud83d\ude40. I only did 1 task and somehow won the biggest multiplier. Also, the TNA Speedrun Challenge is ending soon. Be sure to submit your runs for LE rewards! If you aren\u2019t already in the Adonis Discord, the link is in the #guild-info channel. Our annual Secret Santa is currently underway! Everyone participating will give the requested present to Calluum, who will then distribute to the person who requested it. Merry Christmas to everyone in it.

Congratulations to all our recent promotees, and I hope to see some new names up here soon! Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f There was no military section originally so I'll add one: Highest ANO has been on the leaderboard (Season 8) Events: A Deeper Dive on Their Impacts \ud83c\udf0e (Bee) Hi everyone, I know it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve heard from me in this form, but hi! I\u2019m not dead! You may also notice that this Titan Times is looking a bit different to some of the more previous publications I\u2019ve worked on. We\u2019re trying something new by showcasing more writers (one perspective gets pretty boring after a while if you ask me)! Hopefully all of you can get just as excited about the changes as I am. But enough digressing! Being both a war and community guild, events are an important part of how we can tend to our community side. There are many types of events to be experienced in your time in ANO; that got me thinking: how do different types of events impact our players? Are they happy with the frequency and type of events we\u2019re hosting? What about official serverwide events such as the 2nd Annual Festival of the Bonfire not too long ago? While our warring members are of course an important aspect of the guild, I wanted to see how well we were taking care of our community players (and of course not forgetting the players who engage with both)! To figure this out, I went ahead and interviewed a handful of members of all ranks to gain a wider perspective on how the members of ANO feel about our events! While some direct quotes from their answers might be added for notable responses, I\u2019ll be generous and summarize the conglomerate of responses I received (also a huge shoutout to those of you who were willing to answer all my questions with thoughtful, in-depth responses. It helps to make my writing more interesting and, in this case, will hopefully give our events team helpful feedback)! So without further ado, let\u2019s get into it. Have you attended in-game events created by the Wynn content team and/or participated in other guild-hosted events either in game or otherwise? If so, which? Of course this had to be my first question to help establish a common ground. Everyone I spoke with had played in the Festival of the Bonfire back in September, but other common responses were the trivia events hosted by the Llamas and events hosted over in our community alliance, Adonis. Sidetracking for a moment here, for those of you who might be new here or just missed this somehow, we\u2019re part of a community alliance that hosts events with AVO and ESI every so often. If that seems like something you might be interested in, make sure you use the invite link in #guild-info for the discord! Have official in-game events (ie the Festival of the Blizzard) encouraged you to play an additional amount, or when you otherwise might not have (such as during a different time of day)? What have been the main reasons you have decided to play during an official event? This was nearly unanimous in answer, which didn\u2019t surprise me at all (I definitely play more during the Festival events). Our guild members love the opportunity to obtain exclusive cosmetics and event items! We\u2019ve seen several \u201cFestival\u201d events in-game over the last year or so. Which of these have been your favorite and why? The Festival of the Bonfire from this past year seemed to be ANO\u2019s favorite thus far, even amongst those who had played during other festivals. The minigame in this event was a crowd favorite. Official events are usually focused on pre-existing game lore the content team has already created. How important is game lore to you to your enjoyment of the game? Personally, I wish the Wynn content team leaned harder into the lore they\u2019ve created. They leave a lot of loose threads in their lore, and they frequently have 1 quest involving a certain world built aspect just to have it never come up again (looking at you Eltom). I digress; other members seem pretty evenly split. Some people feel similar to me and think complete worldbuilding is very important to them, where others don\u2019t care much about the lore at all. Lamadile had a great take, saying \u201c[... I] still enjoy [the game] very much so I'd say not very important, although definitely worth experiencing [...].\u201d What do you think the content team could improve upon to make official events more enjoyable? There were some good responses here. While Twelven and others really like these types of events as they are, Lamadile was thinking more events similar to the Wynnter Fair with unique areas and minigames, and Seaskipper had the thought of using minigames as a way to obtain higher tier festival crates rather than having the daily + weekly quests be the only way to obtain them besides actually purchasing them off the store (which for the record, I think could be a FANTASTIC idea because it gives people more incentive to interact with more of the event features). Have guild-organized (ANO or otherwise) in-game events encouraged you to play an additional amount, or when you otherwise may not have? What have been the main reasons you have decided to participate in a guild-organized event? The biggest roadblock for people joining in on guild organized events was time. Because of a lot of time zone differences, many of the people I spoke with felt frustrated that they weren\u2019t able to attend more of these events because they\u2019re frequently unable to attend. Lack of attendance wasn\u2019t for lack of wanting to! But players didn\u2019t want to drastically change their IRL plans in order to attend an event at odd hours for them. Many said they would join if they were available because they wanted to improve their sense of community. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being not at all, and 10 being the most, how much have you felt that in-game events have improved your enjoyment of Wynncraft? Almost all my respondents rated the amount of enjoyment improval at a 5 or higher, with the exception of Micah, who did still mention these types of events improved his enjoyment of the game, just not as highly as other players. I think Asoart said it best: \u201cI love the [guild-hosted] in-game events [...] it makes it easier for the people to join and makes the guild more active overall.\u201d Titans Valor has previously hosted a seasonal event in December open to the public Wynn community. This is usually a multiple-day event with many parts including a winter movie night, races, seasonal skin contests, raffles with a variety of prizes, and more! We may host this again this year and for many years to come. Is there anything that the events team could do to make this event more enjoyable for you? This question made me realize just how many new players we\u2019ve welcomed into our community in the last year! While the likelihood of ANO Wynnterfest taking place this year is still uncertain (Ice is usually the organizer and host for this event, but he is on long-term hiatus for now), I still wanted to feel out players\u2019 thoughts for an event of this magnitude and see if there were any suggestions that could be implemented for future years (or any other event on a large scale)! Most of my respondents have never attended ANO Wynnterfest, but Cyntie\u2019s suggestion really stood out to me: I think events could be two times a day [...] there is such a big difference in time zones from western countries and eastern countries, most people from a certain time zone aren\u2019t able to make it.\u201d Have guild-organized 3rd-party events (such as movie nights, Mineplex minigames, Spectral Zone, etc.,) encouraged you to play an additional amount or when you otherwise might not have? How do you feel events impact your sense of community within the guild? I didn\u2019t expect this to be such a polarizing question, seeing as these types of events have been hosted with a bit higher frequency in the last several months. Some players mentioned these types of events being their favorite and want to see more of these. Other players like these events least, noting the turnout was lower compared to when they\u2019d attended other events hosted in Wynncraft. Personally, I have yet to attend an event like this, but I hope to join at some point in the future! Are there events that you want to see more of, or events we haven\u2019t yet hosted that you\u2019d like to see? List or give ideas here. Two main standouts here: Wynncraft Trivia and Mineplex Minigames (or Hypixel, both were mentioned by multiple people)! Our guild members like easy to understand and want the most people to be able to join and have fun. And really, why hold events if the rules are difficult to understand and people don\u2019t want to join? I think our events team has been great about keeping things simple in the time I\u2019ve been in ANO, which makes our time spent together that much more enjoyable! Are there any other comments you have about events? Here\u2019s a handful of responses: \u201cI appreciate our cabinets on making wynncraft community more fun and giving people something to enjoy beside the casual wynncraft gameplay\u201d \u201cI love the fact that the guild hosts events, I plan on participating in many events in the future!\u201d \u201cI'm looking forward to any and all christmas related events, hoping there will be a secret santa too.\u201d (wish granted hehe) \u201cYes events\u201d Certainly lots to think about when it comes to how, why, and what types of events we host! This one was for you, events team, so hopefully you\u2019ll take something away from all of this, and hope the rest of you enjoyed reading about some of our thoughts about the events we host. If you have any suggestions about future events, feel free to talk with anyone who has the Titans Spirit role, or consider applying to the cabinet yourself if you\u2019d like to take a more active role in planning and hosting events for your fellow guild members to enjoy. Thanks for taking the time to read my (and everyone else\u2019s) writings, and I hope to see you all at future events! Festival of the Blizzard \u2744\ufe0f (Geb) Just like last year around Christmas time, Salted has blessed us with another Wynncraft Event! This time around it\u2019s the Festival of the Blizzard, a winter/Christmas-themed event that brings with it the usual redesign of Detlas, fun minigames, free crates as well as an NPC fetch quest. A quick guide to collecting NPCs \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f Similarly to last year, you get to invite all kinds of NPCs from around the map about the Christmas festivities in Detlas! The more you collect, the more of them will be in Detlas to give you gifts by the time Christmas rolls around. To start the quest, simply talk to The Traveler below the big Christmas tree in Detlas; he will tell you who you should look for! Then you go out and travel the world in search of new NPCs to add to your collection! Most of the NPCs available will most likely be the same as last year, so veterans will have an easier time completing The Traveler\u2019s tasks. But don\u2019t fret just because you weren\u2019t here for the event last year, I'm sure some kind soul will create a list with all the NPCs and where to find them on the forums, just like they have for every previous event. Once the NPCs you talked to have arrived in Detlas, you get to chit-chat with them there to learn about what they\u2019ve been up to recently. Besides learning some interesting lore, some of the NPCs will also hand out gifts if you know which dialogue options to choose. So don\u2019t hesitate too long or you might miss out on some fancy gifts and collectibles. Minigames in North Lusuco \ud83d\udef7 As this event is centred around Christmas, the Minigame Hub for this event is located in North Lusuco! You can get there either with the event airship from Detlas or by taking the usual route through the tunnel in Lusuco. Awaiting you there is a multitude of minigame: Santa Says: You and up to 2 other players get to complete fast-paced tasks for Santa. There is a huge variety of tasks ranging from baking cakes to rescuing reindeer Dodge Em : In this game, one of your turns into the hunter that has to activate icicles to try and push down all other players as they frantically dodge your attacks before the time limit runs out Thin Ice : Up to 8 players get to compete in a TNT-Run style game to see who survives the longest. Anyone that fell down early gets to watch from a spectator area above the arena Pig Puck : While this game is available all year round, now is the best time to grab your friends, form two teams and go head to head in this ice hockey inspired game Parkour : The parkour invites all players that dare to attempt it to a challenging set of parkour gauntlets, but most players just cheese the whole thing with movement spells anyway Spread around North Lusuco are a bunch of cool NPCs selling Christmas-themed armour, accessories and collectibles, but most of them are in no way worth the hefty price tag they come attached to (although I heard the Yahya Tree is pretty nifty). Christmas-themed Detlas and Blizzard crates \ud83c\udf81 I hope you like the new Detlas, it\u2019s here to stay all the way up to New Year\u2019s Day, which is when the Festival of the Blizzard will end. This will give you plenty of time to admire the reworked Detlas, granted you\u2019re not out looking for NPCs or playing minigames. Out of all the reworked versions of Detlas, the Christmas-themed one probably has the most for you to find and interact with. Like the Yeti next to the big Christmas tree in the centre. Or all the souvenir merchants, references to past events, and the NPCs from around the provinces you invited. With all of that going on, I would not be surprised if there was a secret or two, or even three for you to uncover in this event\u2019s version of Detlas. While you\u2019re busy with all the Christmas shenanigans, don\u2019t forget to do your daily and weekly objectives to get the special Blizzard Crates. You can get a T1 chest every day and a T2 chest once a week, meaning you can get up to 30 free crates if you also get the 3 from the shop! Free crates are nice and all, but don\u2019t let that stop you from gambling away all your money by buying more crates from the Wynncraft Store to get those sweet cosmetics. Comments from the community As per usual I asked some members of the community to share their thoughts on the event. These are some of the answers I received: \u201cThe worst thing about the new Detlas is that there isn\u2019t more of it\u201d \u201cWhy does playing Santa Says feel like doing tasks in Among Us?\u201d \u201cWhy are you asking me I only logged on to do my daily objective\u201d \u201cBetter than the Bonfire event\u201d \u201cMinigames were actually pretty fun ngl\u201d Member Shout of the Publication Jk725 , ong.

I\u2019m not dead! You may also notice that this Titan Times is looking a bit different to some of the more previous publications I\u2019ve worked on. We\u2019re trying something new by showcasing more writers (one perspective gets pretty boring after a while if you ask me)! Hopefully all of you can get just as excited about the changes as I am. But enough digressing! Being both a war and community guild, events are an important part of how we can tend to our community side. There are many types of events to be experienced in your time in ANO; that got me thinking: how do different types of events impact our players? Are they happy with the frequency and type of events we\u2019re hosting? What about official serverwide events such as the 2nd Annual Festival of the Bonfire not too long ago? While our warring members are of course an important aspect of the guild, I wanted to see how well we were taking care of our community players (and of course not forgetting the players who engage with both)! To figure this out, I went ahead and interviewed a handful of members of all ranks to gain a wider perspective on how the members of ANO feel about our events! While some direct quotes from their answers might be added for notable responses, I\u2019ll be generous and summarize the conglomerate of responses I received (also a huge shoutout to those of you who were willing to answer all my questions with thoughtful, in-depth responses.

Also hi new members, welcome to the Titan Times, the best place to get your fill on guild activity and insights on all things Wynn! We\u2019ve got a bit of a new format for this one (not too drastic, don\u2019t worry) and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! And yes, since it\u2019s been a moment, there\u2019s a whole lot of catching up to do. So many events to talk about, plus a special interview all about warring with 4Nz1K. Let\u2019s get into it! Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5 We\u2019re starting today with my favorite part of this whole publication: promotions! Back in the very beginning of the year, we hailed in our favorite llama duo as brand new councilors: Ugastag and Biblonko! A well-deserved title for them I\u2019m sure anyone would agree. Huge congrats guys! Dr_san, Flipiik, and Endriik were all promoted to Artificer. Have fun looking over all those applications now! ender_non, omitel1, ExpertPlayer1, SerbosFawkes, Mr_Chicken79, Tfood, Poopdolla, Viirns, _Skriptz, AtlasOpus, Smmychoise, Luxyi, Lurk1ng_, YourAIdiot, 5mut1, _Admiral_Kiwi_, Boltified, and Throw1x were all promoted to Sorcerer! Your dedication to the guild has not gone unnoticed. Congrats to all of our promoted members. I can\u2019t wait to see some new names up here very soon! Quite unexpectedly, we had the 2.0.2 update release not long ago. This added a whole bunch of class rebalancing, bug fixes, and most importantly, Guild Housing ! Reginald chilling with Nimbuh and Cynthia That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve all got one big plot to present ourselves to the world on. Check out the guild housing when you get a chance, and make sure to upvote it! If you\u2019re interested in helping with building, let Cal know. Some of the guild members had also previously done a lot of work on ppfart\u2019s housing plot, so make sure to head over there and give it an upvote too. What\u2019s in the Cupboard? ANO Cabinet Review Spirits Titan\u2019s Spirit is our events team, and my my, they\u2019ve been busy! Micah recently hosted a multi-part event so that members across time zones could participate in some way or another. Great idea on his part! First up was Hide-n-Seek, where players are given a region of the map to hide in and seekers do their best to find all the hiders (yes, it\u2019s self-explanatory I know). GebutterteWurst managed to win that one by winning the most rounds overall, but notable hider skoneez was able to remain hidden through all rounds. Great job to both of them! Next up was a lighthearted game of Gartic Phone. For those who haven\u2019t played before, it\u2019s a cross between Telephone and Pictionary. This usually results in a lot of laughter and a good time had by all. Rounding out the event were some casual Hypixel minigames. Event-goers made their way through all the \u201cwars\u201d type games. This was a fun way to end the day! BeGruent hosted a really fun Wynncraft Bingo event, in which players were given a randomly generated bingo card full of crafting ingredients, and whoever had the most bingos won. I may or may not have shown my tryhard side by completely filling my bingo card to win the event, but skoneez, GebutterteWurst, Aemor, and baldsniper24488 made up the rest of the top 5! I really enjoyed this event and hope to see another like it soon. Smtn Else ally [MALD] held an open parkour event last month. Participants raced against each other to complete the player-made map in the least amount of time. GebutterteWurst and Micah both made it into the top 5, and LaMDaKiS won the event! Congrats to our ANO participants for asserting their dominance over the other guilds with their superior parkour skills! \ud83d\ude3c Biblonko and Ugastag put together Wynncraft Geoguesser, in which players were provided screenshots of obscure locations within the Wynncraft map; whoever correctly identified the location and sent a screenshot of themselves there would win the points for that round. GebutterteWurst came out on top with a total of 10 points, but kebadonner, Endriik, Aemor, LaMDaKiS, Flipiik, Throw1x, and Dr_san all won at least one round. Congrats everyone! Don\u2019t forget that BlueTheSniper hosts games all the time over in Blue\u2019s Builds! If you haven\u2019t joined his server yet, ANO members get an exclusive ANO role and automatic VIP status (not to mention the giant compilation of builds available for all your needs). If you\u2019ve read this far and still haven\u2019t joined, head on over to Blue's Builds . HAPPENING NOW : BeGruent is hosting a Wynncraft photography contest! Think you know of the prettiest spot on the Wynncraft map? Prove it by taking a screenshot and sending it to him (I might also note that shaders and mods to increase render distance ARE allowed and might get you some extra brownie points). Some nice prizes at stake for a fun and easy-to-enter event! Events are a fun way to engage with our community in a laid-back and welcoming manner, so hopefully we see you at one in the near future! Like the idea of attending events but don\u2019t see something you like? Consider applying to Titan\u2019s Spirit and hosting it yourself! Fresh ideas are always welcome. Brilliance Titan\u2019s Brilliance is both our coding cabinet and houses our creative works. It\u2019s been fascinating watching the progress these guys have been making (the Times might technically be under the Brilliance umbrella, but I know fuck all about coding.) Lamadile has been hard at work giving our website a facelift (and by facelift, I really mean complete reconstruction.) While changes are still ongoing, it looks incredible! Check it out here if you haven\u2019t seen it. You can also find previous volumes of the Times on here if you want to revisit them. Our bot, Valor, is in the process of getting some new features (mostly being worked on by Raw, but not entirely). While new commands are something that we\u2019re always looking into in order to meet new needs, a notable mention is that user interactions are in the works for Valor. That\u2019s right, buttons! Buttons for YOU to click! Hopefully these will be fully integrated soon, so keep your eyes peeled. I, of course, am frequently brainstorming new topics to add to our Main Stage. Got a suggestion? Write it and send it to me! Are you enthusiastic about coding projects? Interested in doing some creative writing? Is graphic design your passion? Consider joining Titan\u2019s Brilliance today Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f While technically not a cabinet (RIP Titan\u2019s Fury), military updates will be here from now on! Season 10 has come to a close! We ended this season in 5th place tentatively, season is ongoing for a few hours as I'm writing. Thank you to everyone who participated in defending our ocean claim this season, as well as participating in FFAs. I\u2019m sure next season will be just as successful. That being said, this season of Ocean Trials has come to a close as well. Double-check your submitted war counts are accurate so you receive the correct amount of LE for your efforts. \u201cHey Bee, what\u2019s Ocean Trials?\u201d Great question, new member! With each guild war season, there coexists Ocean Trials, a way in which you can earn LE for participating in wars. We have started requiring members to use ANOMod in order to participate. This is just an easier way for us to track war counts, but is compatible with Wynntils and your other favorite mods. Does this seem like something you might want to participate in during the upcoming season? Check out #ocean-trials-info after making sure you have the military role, and feel free to ask questions in #military-chat Some exciting news: Asoart has been promoted to chief in game for his continued contributions to the war effort. Congrats Aso! Dr_san has also passed the strategist test! This is no easy feat, and requires a solid understanding of economics. Make sure you congratulate him if you see him online! Here\u2019s a reminder that who is Sorcerer and has logged 25 wars is eligible to apply for captain, and any Artificer with 300 logged wars can apply to take the strategist test (especially encouraged if you\u2019re active during NA timezones, we\u2019re desperate for more NA ecoers)! Main Stage: Exclusive Interview with 4Nz1K Ah, 4N, most of us know him as a pretty chill guy and someone who adds a lot of positivity to our guild community. Some of our newer members may not know, however, that he\u2019s a talented war participant and economist. Having recently passed his 1 year anniversary with the guild, I wanted to take the time to talk with him about his war experience and time in ANO. What made you decide to join ANO? \u201cTitan\u2019s Valor is actually the first and only guild I have ever been in. I had only just returned to Wynncraft after seven years of not playing (yikes), and I didn\u2019t know very much about ANO or about guilds in general for that matter; I had simply seen a shout in global chat from Cal recruiting and I decided to apply via Discord like most of our new recruits do! Needless to say, I was very surprised when I learned how large the ANO community was and how influential its presence has been on Wynncraft over the years. The reputation for integrity and inclusiveness that Titan\u2019s Valor leadership and its members have worked hard to cultivate, build up, and maintain among the Wynn community over the years is a legacy I am very proud to help carry on and why I refuse to go anywhere else.\u201d How did you first get into warring? Was there any sort of draw for you? \u201cI have to credit Aiza, 1000%. Since I knew nothing about guilds, I also knew nothing about warring, but I was eager to help the guild as a newer recruit and make a place for myself in the guild. I scraped together enough LE to buy a decent Limbo build for war which at the time was one of the worst DPS war builds (still is), after which Aiza with his KoH healer and me with DPS would war together for hours every night, circling Light Forest and Cinfras County claiming FFA\u2019s while watching youtube or anime in the background. In my first ever warring season, Aiza and I did over 700 wars together, earning me the Conquest Medal for my efforts and solidifying myself as a \u201cknown warrer\u201d in the guild since. Without Aiza there to support me early on I genuinely don\u2019t believe I would have become as fond of guild wars as I am today.\u201d How do you feel about the changes to wars over the years? \u201cUnfortunately, as a latecomer to the war scene, I didn\u2019t experience the switch from 1.19 to 1.20; I have experienced several balance changes to classes/gear as well as the update to Wynncraft 2.0 (Spellbound) which completely reworked class spells, added new abilities, etc. which have all been dramatic game changers for myself and other regular warrers. While I find the overall state of wars to be enjoyable I must say I have learned one thing in regard to guild warring in my short time, which is that the \u201cmeta\u201d for war builds constantly fluctuates with the ongoing new updates and what was once one of the best builds can simply become useless once a class rebalance takes place. Adapting to such wild swings in the war meta I feel can be very challenging to some people, especially newer players just learning how things work, but overall I am happy with the current state of wars although I am excited to see what future updates have in store for us!\u201d What aspect of warring do you enjoy the most? How about enjoy the least? \u201cI have to say my favorite aspect of warring is the people themselves who do it; the motivation that players have to work together to learn as a team and get better at it never fails to impress me when I see it unfolding. When I first joined ANO there were a few consistent players who warred regularly, but in a year I have seen the interest in warring grow so much that now when someone queues FFAs (Free for All Territories for you non warring members) there is often more players who show up than can fit and there is always a new face each time! As for the least enjoyable part of warring, I have to say it's the financial burden and the way that limits new warrers ability to get started. Many war builds use mythics and crafted armor and accessories\u2014these items can be priced wildly depending on availability, current demand, etc. A good example is the Absolution war build: currently it is the meta healer for war but because of high demand the mythic alone costs (I believe) 8-10stx for a decent one. So are you a shaman and want to war? Better be rich to start! You also have to hope that the meta doesn\u2019t change in a new update/class nerf and make that investment you made into those items completely worthless. While it\u2019s unfortunate and severely limiting to many players, it\u2019s less a problem with warring itself and more a problem with the Trade Market/Mythic economy.\u201d What\u2019s your favorite war build? (you don\u2019t have to give all the specifics if it\u2019s a trade secret \ud83d\ude09) \u201cI will give you my top three! Currently my favorite build is the Monster/Crabs Solo build, I quite enjoy mage and being able to solo FFAs allows me to war on my own time if there is no one else to join me. Second favorite is Infernal Impulse/Guardian build, it is a critical piece to warring enemy HQs because its high HP allows it to be a frontline tank and pseudo-healer for the team thanks to the effects of II. Finally, my third favorite build is my Limbo/Warchief build. It is a bad build in the current meta but my first 700 wars were done on that build so it will forever hold a special place in my heart.\u201d Is there anything you hope gets added to/removed from/changed about warring in future updates? \u201cOne thing I hope for would be rebalancing to mage. It lost its viability as a healer for war in the Spellbound update and hasn\u2019t recovered since. Having only shaman as a healer option is limiting to players who don\u2019t invest as much time into other classes. In regard to things changed I can\u2019t honestly say anything specific; I think in large part things are fine as they are. For my own sake I would love to see a max cap of like 13-15 minutes for war timers. I hate waiting almost half an hour to FFA Jungle territories.\u201d What advice would you give to new guild members who are interested in learning to war? \u201cEase into it. Jumping fresh into warring can be very fun, but as I said before it also is a huge financial commitment to get the builds needed. I recommend taking time to really decide what role is going to best fit your playstyle. Are you a DPS person? Do you prefer to be a healer? How about a tank? What does your budget look like for war? Always speak with more experienced players who can point you in the right direction to get started and don\u2019t over commit unless you are ready to really go for it. While ANO always loves to have more war capable individuals, we also want you to make wise decisions and not rush into it without having all the information you need first.\u201d What advice would you give to those who want to learn eco? \u201cFinding someone to \u201cteach\u201d you how to eco is tough sometimes, but fortunately we have several talented economists who can provide you some guidance on how the system works. We also have a few handy resources like the war document and some other 3rd party economy guides we can share with players, but most of your actual know-how with economy will come from hands-on experience. Start small by adjusting simple things like resources to cover FFA defenses, removing/adding emerald and tome seekings, that sort of thing. By doing this often you will get a feel for the eco UI and develop an understanding of how it reacts to your adjustments, letting you eco more comfortably when serious situations arise. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Get in there, press buttons, ruin the economy, learn how to fix it, become an economy master. You can do it! What do you enjoy about ANO and/or Wynn outside of warring? \u201cMy favorite thing about ANO is obviously its community, the quality of people and their willingness to go above and beyond to help each other regularly is something I don\u2019t think a lot of other guilds likely have. When I first joined I was practically \u201cbrand new\u201d to Wynn and knew nothing, but with the help of many amazing people I have become a much more experienced player in many aspects of the game. Nowadays when I am not warring I spend my time on Wynn typically loot running, building in my housing, or flipping items on the Trade Market, all of which I have had help from other guild members in learning/doing. Who I am as a player today would be impossible without Titan\u2019s Valor so I am very proud to still be a member a year later.\u201d What\u2019s been your favorite memory in ANO so far? \u201cIt has been awhile but I was very fond of my first Award ceremony I attended, being in a Discord call with 25-30+ guild members and everyone joking around having fun was a blast. During the ceremony I remember Nimbuh attempting to interrupt so many times he was muted by Cal lol. I had a lot of fun that day and earned my own Conquest Medal, but another reason I am very fond of it is because Aiza was awarded the Valorian Star for his efforts put into the guild, and since he had practically taken me under his wing as a warrer during that time I was very happy to see his efforts recognized.\u201d Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say to readers? \u201cIf you have any interest in warring or learning economy feel free to reach out to me in game or on Discord. I am always willing to help aspiring warrers (or any guild member for that matter) if they need it! If you are someone who is already experienced with wars and eco I encourage you to be a source of information/advice for newer generations of members, help them grow as people once helped us! Thanks for listening to what I had to say!\u201d if you are wondering how many total words are in 4n's responses, there are 1563. Talking with 4N was super fun and I\u2019m so glad he was enthusiastic to answer some of my questions. He brings such a positive energy to the guild, and I can say with confidence he\u2019s become an integral part of ANO over the last year. Thank you 4Nz1K for sharing your knowledge with us!

Closing Remarks Hi everyone, if you made it this far, thank you! Your support and enjoyment of these publications is what fuels me to continue writing them. The new segment is the part I\u2019m most unsure about, but I did really want to highlight all the neat stuff all our cabinets are doing. Warring isn\u2019t everything in a guild! Again, big thank you to 4Nz1k for taking the time to do this interview, it was one of my favorite ones I\u2019ve ever done. Any future interviewees, take notes! His thoroughness makes for a more interesting read for all of you.

Micah recently hosted a multi-part event so that members across time zones could participate in some way or another. Great idea on his part! First up was Hide-n-Seek, where players are given a region of the map to hide in and seekers do their best to find all the hiders (yes, it\u2019s self-explanatory I know). GebutterteWurst managed to win that one by winning the most rounds overall, but notable hider skoneez was able to remain hidden through all rounds. Great job to both of them! Next up was a lighthearted game of Gartic Phone. For those who haven\u2019t played before, it\u2019s a cross between Telephone and Pictionary. This usually results in a lot of laughter and a good time had by all. Rounding out the event were some casual Hypixel minigames. Event-goers made their way through all the \u201cwars\u201d type games. This was a fun way to end the day! BeGruent hosted a really fun Wynncraft Bingo event, in which players were given a randomly generated bingo card full of crafting ingredients, and whoever had the most bingos won. I may or may not have shown my tryhard side by completely filling my bingo card to win the event, but skoneez, GebutterteWurst, Aemor, and baldsniper24488 made up the rest of the top 5! I really enjoyed this event and hope to see another like it soon. Smtn Else ally [MALD] held an open parkour event last month. Participants raced against each other to complete the player-made map in the least amount of time. GebutterteWurst and Micah both made it into the top 5, and LaMDaKiS won the event! Congrats to our ANO participants for asserting their dominance over the other guilds with their superior parkour skills! \ud83d\ude3c Biblonko and Ugastag put together Wynncraft Geoguesser, in which players were provided screenshots of obscure locations within the Wynncraft map; whoever correctly identified the location and sent a screenshot of themselves there would win the points for that round. GebutterteWurst came out on top with a total of 10 points, but kebadonner, Endriik, Aemor, LaMDaKiS, Flipiik, Throw1x, and Dr_san all won at least one round. Congrats everyone! Don\u2019t forget that BlueTheSniper hosts games all the time over in Blue\u2019s Builds! If you haven\u2019t joined his server yet, ANO members get an exclusive ANO role and automatic VIP status (not to mention the giant compilation of builds available for all your needs). If you\u2019ve read this far and still haven\u2019t joined, head on over to Blue's Builds . HAPPENING NOW : BeGruent is hosting a Wynncraft photography contest! Think you know of the prettiest spot on the Wynncraft map? Prove it by taking a screenshot and sending it to him (I might also note that shaders and mods to increase render distance ARE allowed and might get you some extra brownie points). Some nice prizes at stake for a fun and easy-to-enter event! Events are a fun way to engage with our community in a laid-back and welcoming manner, so hopefully we see you at one in the near future! Like the idea of attending events but don\u2019t see something you like? Consider applying to Titan\u2019s Spirit and hosting it yourself!

Lamadile has been hard at work giving our website a facelift (and by facelift, I really mean complete reconstruction.) While changes are still ongoing, it looks incredible! Check it out here if you haven\u2019t seen it. You can also find previous volumes of the Times on here if you want to revisit them. Our bot, Valor, is in the process of getting some new features (mostly being worked on by Raw, but not entirely). While new commands are something that we\u2019re always looking into in order to meet new needs, a notable mention is that user interactions are in the works for Valor. That\u2019s right, buttons!

With each guild war season, there coexists Ocean Trials, a way in which you can earn LE for participating in wars. We have started requiring members to use ANOMod in order to participate. This is just an easier way for us to track war counts, but is compatible with Wynntils and your other favorite mods. Does this seem like something you might want to participate in during the upcoming season?

Here\u2019s a reminder that who is Sorcerer and has logged 25 wars is eligible to apply for captain, and any Artificer with 300 logged wars can apply to take the strategist test (especially encouraged if you\u2019re active during NA timezones, we\u2019re desperate for more NA ecoers)!","title":"Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f"},{"location":"vol8/#main-stage-exclusive-interview-with-4nz1k","text":"Ah, 4N, most of us know him as a pretty chill guy and someone who adds a lot of positivity to our guild community.

Needless to say, I was very surprised when I learned how large the ANO community was and how influential its presence has been on Wynncraft over the years. The reputation for integrity and inclusiveness that Titan\u2019s Valor leadership and its members have worked hard to cultivate, build up, and maintain among the Wynn community over the years is a legacy I am very proud to help carry on and why I refuse to go anywhere else.\u201d","title":"What made you decide to join ANO?"},{"location":"vol8/#how-did-you-first-get-into-warring-was-there-any-sort-of-draw-for-you","text":"\u201cI have to credit Aiza, 1000%. Since I knew nothing about guilds, I also knew nothing about warring, but I was eager to help the guild as a newer recruit and make a place for myself in the guild. I scraped together enough LE to buy a decent Limbo build for war which at the time was one of the worst DPS war builds (still is), after which Aiza with his KoH healer and me with DPS would war together for hours every night, circling Light Forest and Cinfras County claiming FFA\u2019s while watching youtube or anime in the background. In my first ever warring season, Aiza and I did over 700 wars together, earning me the Conquest Medal for my efforts and solidifying myself as a \u201cknown warrer\u201d in the guild since.

While I find the overall state of wars to be enjoyable I must say I have learned one thing in regard to guild warring in my short time, which is that the \u201cmeta\u201d for war builds constantly fluctuates with the ongoing new updates and what was once one of the best builds can simply become useless once a class rebalance takes place. Adapting to such wild swings in the war meta I feel can be very challenging to some people, especially newer players just learning how things work, but overall I am happy with the current state of wars although I am excited to see what future updates have in store for us!\u201d","title":"How do you feel about the changes to wars over the years?"},{"location":"vol8/#what-aspect-of-warring-do-you-enjoy-the-most-how-about-enjoy-the-least","text":"\u201cI have to say my favorite aspect of warring is the people themselves who do it; the motivation that players have to work together to learn as a team and get better at it never fails to impress me when I see it unfolding. When I first joined ANO there were a few consistent players who warred regularly, but in a year I have seen the interest in warring grow so much that now when someone queues FFAs (Free for All Territories for you non warring members) there is often more players who show up than can fit and there is always a new face each time! As for the least enjoyable part of warring, I have to say it's the financial burden and the way that limits new warrers ability to get started. Many war builds use mythics and crafted armor and accessories\u2014these items can be priced wildly depending on availability, current demand, etc. A good example is the Absolution war build: currently it is the meta healer for war but because of high demand the mythic alone costs (I believe) 8-10stx for a decent one. So are you a shaman and want to war? Better be rich to start! You also have to hope that the meta doesn\u2019t change in a new update/class nerf and make that investment you made into those items completely worthless. While it\u2019s unfortunate and severely limiting to many players, it\u2019s less a problem with warring itself and more a problem with the Trade Market/Mythic economy.\u201d","title":"What aspect of warring do you enjoy the most?

Finally, my third favorite build is my Limbo/Warchief build. It is a bad build in the current meta but my first 700 wars were done on that build so it will forever hold a special place in my heart.\u201d","title":"What\u2019s your favorite war build?

It lost its viability as a healer for war in the Spellbound update and hasn\u2019t recovered since. Having only shaman as a healer option is limiting to players who don\u2019t invest as much time into other classes. In regard to things changed I can\u2019t honestly say anything specific; I think in large part things are fine as they are.

Jumping fresh into warring can be very fun, but as I said before it also is a huge financial commitment to get the builds needed. I recommend taking time to really decide what role is going to best fit your playstyle. Are you a DPS person? Do you prefer to be a healer? How about a tank? What does your budget look like for war? Always speak with more experienced players who can point you in the right direction to get started and don\u2019t over commit unless you are ready to really go for it.

Start small by adjusting simple things like resources to cover FFA defenses, removing/adding emerald and tome seekings, that sort of thing. By doing this often you will get a feel for the eco UI and develop an understanding of how it reacts to your adjustments, letting you eco more comfortably when serious situations arise.

Recent Happenings \ud83d\udcc5 First on the docket is a reminder that our Guild Housing recently hit 1000 upvotes ! Our guild housing was the first (and, at the time of writing, only) public housing plot to do so. Our builders have been hard at work carrying out their magnificent plans, so if you haven\u2019t seen it recently, make sure you check it out. As a side note, the guild housing is not yet complete. If you think you\u2019ve got the building skills and are interested in helping work on the project, be sure to ask a council member! I\u2019ll tease it now even though I\u2019ll be talking about this more in a bit, but congrats to Geb and Aemor on our first two GXP X awards. This is awarded to members who donate over 100 billion XP to the guild (though they\u2019ve both done considerably more than that). They, amongst others, have been hard at work lately! editor's note: btw, the auto gxp role feature is working now. You can grind xp and automatically have the corresponding role upon reaching the threshold. On to my favorite part of the publication, promotions!

We see all the hard work you\u2019ve been putting into your respective areas. Make sure to congratulate our newest Titan, Aemor ! His hard work grinding GXP and help with warring has been much appreciated. Finally, huge congratulations to Asoart , the newest addition to the Sage Council! His extensive war and eco knowledge, plus being active in the community has put his name as one synonymous with the guild. Hope you\u2019re loving all the new responsibilities! Congrats to all of our promotees! I can\u2019t wait to see new names up here soon. What\u2019s in the Cupboard?: ANO Cabinet Review Spirits You may remember last time that we had an ongoing photography contest hosted by BeGruent . Since then, the event has ended and the judges have spoken. Congratulations to Viirns for his gorgeous photo! _EliteDreamer was the notable runner-up. I did tell you all that nice shaders would get you brownie points, no? Viirns' Winning Capture Over on the Adonis server, our friends from [AVO] hosted a couple of casual art games: skribble.io and Gartic Phone. The former is similar to an online version of Pictionary, where one player is given a word or phrase to draw and everyone else tries to guess what it is. Gartic Phone takes this one step further by adding in rules from the classic game of Telephone. In this game, you begin by writing a word or phrase for someone else to draw, and you then are randomly and anonymously given someone else\u2019s phrase to draw. Players then pass their drawings along again, and you must create a new phrase that describes the drawing. At the end of the round, everyone gets to see how the original phrase progressed. All said and done, hilarity generally ensues. These are low skill, casual games frequently hosted by our events team, so make sure to join the next time someone hosts! Now some of our newer members might be asking \u201chey, what\u2019s Adonis?\u201d Great question recruit! We are part of a community alliance with [AVO] and [ESI] called Adonis. This gives players from different guilds a chance to interact and have more fun together. If you\u2019re not in the server and would like to be, an invite link can be found in #guild-info. Also in Adonis, [ESI] has just wrapped up their item design competition. Participants were asked to imagine a brand new item for Wynncraft across any level range (or even beyond the current level cap). There were several different categories, including best art, best meme, and many more. ANO members swept this competition with their submissions, taking 4 out of 5 of the top spots. Congrats to Acrohh, LaMDaKiS, BeGruent, and Silent__Boss for all of their creative designs! It's a JoJo reference? Our Llama Councilors, Ugastag and Biblonko hosted a Wynncraft Hide-and-Seek event. This time, participants were confined to the city of Ahmsord in the first half, while the second half was played in the Ruined Olmic City. kebabdoner, 28culture, Dr_san, _Constellar, Asoart, LaMDaKiS, and GebutterteWurst all were able to win some rounds (and some LE)! They also debuted a new event over in Adonis: Copycat! Players were given a screenshot of an inventory with 23 items to recreate (sprite-wise) as best they could in the time given. To add to the challenge, all players had to use a new Ironman class. Congratulations to kebabdoner , who took first place with 21 items matched! Asoart tried his hand at hosting his first event: Wynncraft Trivia! Featuring 3 different categories of questions\u2013Wynncraft knowledge, Minecraft knowledge, and general trivial\u2013the first person to answer the question correctly in guild chat was awarded a point for the round. Cal was able to best everyone with his trivia knowledge, earning himself a total of 20 points. Honorable mentions are Geb with 18 points, CloudXYZ15 with 10 points, and Aemor with 8 points. Great job everyone that earned themselves some LE! Speaking of Aemor , he also hosted his first event this month: the \u201cANO Gets to 100\u201d GXP grind event! Participants were awarded raffle tickets for some great prizes depending on the amount of XP they earned. Incentivizing the grind meant that we were able to smash our goal, going from level 97 to 100 in just a few days. Thank you to everyone who participated! Hopefully some of you are enjoying some nice raffle prizes now. Rounding out the Spirit recap is BlueTheSniper , who routinely hosts fun party games, such as Spectral Zone, Bolt, and others. Most recently, he hosted Gartic Phone on our server, but just before that he hosted Kitchen Burnout over in Blue\u2019s Builds. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time for the portion of the publication where I shamelessly promote Blue\u2019s Builds yet again. Blue owns a server that gathers and updates one of the largest collections of Wynncraft builds. If you can think of a build you might want, chances are you can find it already made over on Blue\u2019s Builds. Make sure you head over there if this sounds like something you might be interested in, or you just don\u2019t want to miss out on more fun events! An invite link can be found on his Discord profile. A quick reminder that if you\u2019re interested in creating and hosting guild events in the future, be sure to submit an application to Titan\u2019s Spirit today! Brilliance A much shorter section than the Spirit updates, but hey, Brilliance projects take time to complete. Rest assured, something is always going on quietly. _Constellar is in the process of giving our guild uniforms a facelift. While there isn\u2019t a timeline for when these might be ready for all of you to wear yourselves, be sure to keep your eyes peeled if you\u2019re looking for some new clothes. Something I\u2019m quite excited about is Snazz working on automating some of our Discord roles, such as the GXP and Wars. This will make it much easier for all of you to show off some of the ways in which you contribute to the guild. How neat is that? editor's note: thanks Raw for fixing Snazz's code. And of course, our Times team is always up to something\u2026 If you\u2019ve got coding or creative skills and want to help the guild out in some way, make sure you submit your application for Titan\u2019s Brilliance (to sweeten the deal even further, each task you\u2019re able to complete will earn you some LE \ud83d\ude09)! Military Updates \u2694\ufe0f We\u2019re halfway through Season 11, which still leaves plenty of time to get those wars in for Ocean Trials (or meet the necessary war count if you\u2019re looking to apply for captain or strategist). While we\u2019re on the topic of Ocean Trials, we have a new rewards system in place now! Rewards are distributed on a weekly basis throughout the season, rather than getting a lump sum at the end. Each week, you\u2019ll be given 1 LE for every 15 wars you participate in. During the last week of the season, all rewards will DOUBLE as extra incentive to get a final push up for our season ratings. There are also additional bonuses at the end of the season for whoever gets the most wars overall (and of course the exclusive Champion of the Ocean role in Discord, but this part is not new). As a reminder, if you want to participate in Ocean Trials, you must have ANOmod installed in order to track your wars. Good luck warrers! We have some exciting war-related promotions to announce down here! Flipiik, Endriik, and kebabdoner have all passed the strategist test. This requires a good amount of knowledge about economy and guild politics, so huge congrats to them. Additionally, aFireBlaze was promoted to chief for his invaluable work on eco. Most of NA eco relies on him, so this promotion is more than well-deserved. In a surprise turn of events, [fuy] joined the map-holding alliance mid-season, while [NFR] has left on account of the guild disbanding. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the territory changes: [fuy] has taken over most of [NFR]\u2019s claim, with the exception of Canyon Waterfall North, Bandit Cave Upper, Burning Airship, Cinfras Thanos Transition, Cinfras County Mid-Upper, and Cinfras County Mid-Lower. These territories are now a part of the Light Forest FFA. [UTL] has gained Path to Ozoth\u2019s Spire Mid [ICo] has gained Bandit Camp Exit This doesn\u2019t affect us a whole lot, but we have a bunch of new territories in our popular FFA spot. Great for those wanting to get their war counts up! And that about does it for our military updates! If you don\u2019t currently have the military role and would like it, be sure to ask any Titan+. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions in #military-chat ! Main Stage: ANO Reaches Level \ud83d\udcaf A short and sweet segment this go around, but one no less monumental for it. Titans Valor has finally reached level 100, a goal 7 years in the making! I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight the sense of pride and accomplishment we\u2019re taking (or should be at least) at finally reaching this goal. It was a dream that ANO founder and previous owner, IceResistance, held for all of us. On his eventual return he can be proud that we\u2019ve picked up where he left off and reached his dream for him. Aemor played a huge role for us in getting to this point. He is one of the top GXP grinders in ANO history, but if it weren\u2019t for him organizing and hosting the GXP grind event, it would have been much longer before we were able to reach this momentous goal. Thanks to him and a select few others, we were able to plow through 3 levels in a very short time. Make sure you send a little extra praise his way, he more than deserves it. Here\u2019s a handful of pictures taken in celebration just after we reached 100! To celebrate this momentous occasion, I will be hosting an Item Bomb Party and throwing 100 Item Bombs ! The date is TBA, but I will keep you all updated in coming days either in #guild-announcements or #events. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this amazing goal! Congratulations to us for being the 7th guild to ever reach 100. Member Shout of the Publication _Constellar Be sure to check out the Lazy Llama Cafe (thank you for the tour!)

His hard work grinding GXP and help with warring has been much appreciated. Finally, huge congratulations to Asoart , the newest addition to the Sage Council! His extensive war and eco knowledge, plus being active in the community has put his name as one synonymous with the guild. Hope you\u2019re loving all the new responsibilities!

I did tell you all that nice shaders would get you brownie points, no? Viirns' Winning Capture Over on the Adonis server, our friends from [AVO] hosted a couple of casual art games: skribble.io and Gartic Phone. The former is similar to an online version of Pictionary, where one player is given a word or phrase to draw and everyone else tries to guess what it is. Gartic Phone takes this one step further by adding in rules from the classic game of Telephone. In this game, you begin by writing a word or phrase for someone else to draw, and you then are randomly and anonymously given someone else\u2019s phrase to draw. Players then pass their drawings along again, and you must create a new phrase that describes the drawing. At the end of the round, everyone gets to see how the original phrase progressed. All said and done, hilarity generally ensues. These are low skill, casual games frequently hosted by our events team, so make sure to join the next time someone hosts! Now some of our newer members might be asking \u201chey, what\u2019s Adonis?\u201d Great question recruit! We are part of a community alliance with [AVO] and [ESI] called Adonis. This gives players from different guilds a chance to interact and have more fun together. If you\u2019re not in the server and would like to be, an invite link can be found in #guild-info. Also in Adonis, [ESI] has just wrapped up their item design competition. Participants were asked to imagine a brand new item for Wynncraft across any level range (or even beyond the current level cap). There were several different categories, including best art, best meme, and many more. ANO members swept this competition with their submissions, taking 4 out of 5 of the top spots. Congrats to Acrohh, LaMDaKiS, BeGruent, and Silent__Boss for all of their creative designs! It's a JoJo reference? Our Llama Councilors, Ugastag and Biblonko hosted a Wynncraft Hide-and-Seek event. This time, participants were confined to the city of Ahmsord in the first half, while the second half was played in the Ruined Olmic City. kebabdoner, 28culture, Dr_san, _Constellar, Asoart, LaMDaKiS, and GebutterteWurst all were able to win some rounds (and some LE)! They also debuted a new event over in Adonis: Copycat! Players were given a screenshot of an inventory with 23 items to recreate (sprite-wise) as best they could in the time given. To add to the challenge, all players had to use a new Ironman class. Congratulations to kebabdoner , who took first place with 21 items matched! Asoart tried his hand at hosting his first event: Wynncraft Trivia! Featuring 3 different categories of questions\u2013Wynncraft knowledge, Minecraft knowledge, and general trivial\u2013the first person to answer the question correctly in guild chat was awarded a point for the round. Cal was able to best everyone with his trivia knowledge, earning himself a total of 20 points. Honorable mentions are Geb with 18 points, CloudXYZ15 with 10 points, and Aemor with 8 points. Great job everyone that earned themselves some LE! Speaking of Aemor , he also hosted his first event this month: the \u201cANO Gets to 100\u201d GXP grind event! Participants were awarded raffle tickets for some great prizes depending on the amount of XP they earned. Incentivizing the grind meant that we were able to smash our goal, going from level 97 to 100 in just a few days. Thank you to everyone who participated! Hopefully some of you are enjoying some nice raffle prizes now. Rounding out the Spirit recap is BlueTheSniper , who routinely hosts fun party games, such as Spectral Zone, Bolt, and others. Most recently, he hosted Gartic Phone on our server, but just before that he hosted Kitchen Burnout over in Blue\u2019s Builds. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time for the portion of the publication where I shamelessly promote Blue\u2019s Builds yet again. Blue owns a server that gathers and updates one of the largest collections of Wynncraft builds. If you can think of a build you might want, chances are you can find it already made over on Blue\u2019s Builds. Make sure you head over there if this sounds like something you might be interested in, or you just don\u2019t want to miss out on more fun events! An invite link can be found on his Discord profile.
