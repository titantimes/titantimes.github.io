<p>Hello everyone, and welcome back to another edition of the Times; the best place to get your (bimonthly? Nah, I‚Äôm not organized enough to stick to a schedule for this) digest of guild activity and thoughtful insights into all things Wynn! Lots has happened since my last release, so let‚Äôs jump right into it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="recent-happenings">Recent Happenings</h2>
<p>First up on the docket, promotions! <strong>Aemor</strong>, <strong>Miles</strong>, <strong>CMYBilly</strong>, and <strong>RSpieter99</strong> have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Additionally, <strong>ChristmasBear</strong> has been promoted to Artificer! Congrats to the 5 of you for your promotions, and I hope to see some new names up here soon.</p>
<p>Next up, we had an insane build battle with our ESI friends over in Adonis. Players were split into teams of 3 and given a phrase with which to theme their builds on. Each team had the same amount of time to create their masterpieces. Judges awarded points based on the quality of the build, how well it matched the theme, and creativity of how the theme was executed. Here are some of the winning builds, along with a few other honorable mentions! We do events in Adonis on a somewhat regular basis, so if you‚Äôre not in the discord and want in on the fun, be sure to head over to #guild-info and join the server!</p>

<p>Avicia [AVO] has joined the Adonis alliance to host events and help reduce the load on [ESI] and [ANO].</p>
<p>Another exciting thing in the wider world of Wynn was the release of the full changelog for the Wynncraft 2.0: Spellbound Update! (this is pretty much hot off the presses as I‚Äôm writing this but I‚Äôm confident most of you have seen this anyway). Personally, I have mixed feelings about what‚Äôs been announced, but hey I might just go mess around in the beta once it‚Äôs released and see what it‚Äôs all about. The ‚Äúupdated‚Äù spells are what I feel most concerned about, but with so much of the ability tree unknown, it could be much better than expected. We‚Äôll all just have to wait and see, but 2.0 is coming soon and I‚Äôll certainly be jumping in to experience it! Is anyone else planning on starting a new class for the update? If you haven't read the full changelog yet, you can do so <a href="https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/2-0-spellbound-changelog.299715/">here</a>.</p>
<p>And last but definitely not least, ANO reached level 91! We always love to see the continued growth of this wonderful community. Keep working hard!

<h2 id="military-updates">Military Updates</h2>
<p>Only a few short updates to keep this section brief. Gang of Fools [FOOL] has joined Cucumber Company, our military alliance. Their map claim is the old claim of IceBlue Team [IBT], who have left the alliance and gone mostly inactive. Sad to see them go, but [FOOL] is so far proving a worthy replacement. </p>
<p>Some of our more active military participants have been hitting the FFAs hard these last few weeks, and putting us in 4th position (at time of writing) in the season ratings! Will we make it to the top 3? Not likely! Will we try anyway? Almost certainly!</p>
<p>Also a reminder that our military document has had a bit of a facelift to reflect the current guild community conditions and our alliance change this season. If you haven‚Äôt looked it over in a while, now is a good chance to do so! Or if you‚Äôre not yet part of our military and would like to be, ask a council member for access to our military channels to get started.</p>
<h2 id="main-stage-awards-ceremony">Main Stage: Awards Ceremony</h2>
<p>After nearly a year of trying to get our shit together and make this happen, it finally did: The ANO Awards Ceremony! Awards are given to distinguish players for a variety of reasons in both military and community sectors. I was unfortunately unable to attend this event myself (it was an odd hour for us EST peeps), so I‚Äôll just be giving a summary here. As it has been a while since the last awards ceremony, some of our medal recipients are no longer in the guild, but should still be noted for their efforts during their time in ANO.</p>
<p>First up, the Service Medal, which is awarded to members who are active in our community and contribute some amount of XP to the guild. Recipients are as follows: <strong>RawGamingYT, BROthePRO, Ugastag, Biblonko, LizardGaming13, fatfatsheep87, Miles, ender_non, _Eth3real, LapisPig965, LaMDaKiS, Toasty, Hallomifrendo, GebutterteWurst, KingNoahWilliam, Trigonometri, Aiza, Ohza,</strong> and <strong>UrBroJosh</strong>!</p>
<p>Next up, the Conquest Medal, awarded to players who are active in our military and have participated in a number of successful guild wars. Recipients are as follows: <strong>Snazz, Toasty, Hallomifrendo, xXMemeLord69420, Ugastag, Biblonko, 4Nz1K, TheZeldaBoi, BROthePRO, iThought,</strong> and <strong>Aemor</strong>!</p>
<p>Next up we have the Guidance Medal, awarded to members who are seen helping others on a regular basis, and are just overall helpful players. Recipients are as follows: <strong>4Nz1K, Slime1480, NotableOsprey92,</strong> and <strong>DDuk_Eip</strong>!</p>
<p>Following that, there‚Äôs the Recruiter Award, granted to members who refer players to ANO that later end up becoming active members in our community. Recipients are as follows: <strong>Nimbuh, Aiza, Aezuh,</strong> and <strong>Habidudi</strong>!</p>
<p>Then we have the Invictus Cross, which is awarded to members who have contributed significantly to our military, and often take leadership roles during such. Recipients are <strong>LaMDaKiS, GebutterteWurst,</strong> and <strong>imperathor02</strong>!</p>
<p>Next up is the Imperial Service Medal, which is awarded to leaders of foreign guilds for consistent acts of service to our guild. This time around, the award was granted to <strong>MysticStrider</strong>!</p>
<p>Following that is the Veteran Medal, granted to distinguished former members of ANO, who during their time with us were able to achieve a variety of accomplishments. Recipients are as follows: <strong>imperathor02, PaladinSorcerer, CoderNotGamer,</strong> and <strong>Leonhart_Arkada</strong>!</p>
<p>Finally, we have our newest award, the Valorian Star. This is not given frequently, and only awarded to members who have gone above and beyond in showing their dedication to the guild. I am happy to announce that <strong>Aiza</strong> is the recipient of this award!</p>
<p>Many congratulations to all of our award recipients! I love seeing so many players being recognized for their efforts, and hopefully the next awards ceremony won‚Äôt be over a year away so I can see more names hit this list in the future!</p>

<p>Just something to note, you can view your medals at any time by using <code>-profile</code> in #bots!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>editor's note: Raw is still working on the command lol. There will be an announcement once it is ready.</p>

<p><code>Closing Remarks</code></p>
<p>Thank you all again for reading! I hope these releases are up to the standards of the people, but I will continue dropping reminders that if you ever have any ideas for things you want to see included in the Times, feel free to DM me! Or if you‚Äôre interested in being a part of the Times, submit an application to Titan‚Äôs Brilliance! Doing these on my own can sometimes take longer than I‚Äôd like, but I always have fun with it. Once again, I appreciate your time and interest, and I hope you‚Äôll keep your eyes out for the next release!</p>
